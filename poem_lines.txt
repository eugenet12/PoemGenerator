as one who pausing on the tedious slope
of some high mountain thoughtfully looks back
on the long painful and uncertain track
his feet have trodden  then with awe and hope
commingled gazes where beyond the scope
of utmost vision majestically dread
its cloud capt summit rises over head
so stand i now  henceforward i must cope
with greater perils with less outward aid
father who hast in mercy hitherto
and love and pity guided bear me through
well may i when i ponder be dismayed
my purity is sin  my strength is dust
nor dare i but in thine own promise trust
when from the vaulted wonder of the sky
the curtain of the light is drawn aside
and i behold the stars in all their wide
significance and glorious mystery
assured that those more distant orbs are suns
round which innumerable worlds revolve
my faith grows strong my day born doubts dissolve
and death that dread annulment which life shuns
or fain would shun becomes to life the way
the thoroughfare to greater worlds on high
the bridge from star to star seek how we may
there is no other road across the sky
and looking up i hear star voices say
you could not reach us if you did not die
it fell as softly as the winter's snow
there was no sound of storm nor any stress
no fevered daring of death's mightiness
no struggle for a strong man's overthrow
just some few hours of moaning soft and low
some hard drawn breathing quickly hushed ah yes
and then  and then  small white limbs motionless
while we who wait must whisper as we go
a face and voice we looked for lovingly
lost from the fellowship of our small band
one little ripple of life's restless sea
soothed into stillness by the master's hand
and missing here  but a white soul to stand
in the vast temple of eternity
what is indifference do you ask of me
o well i know the meaning of the phrase
it is to find grey ash instead of blaze
that warmed you once to lose alas the key
which turned in friendship's wards to sometime see
the eyes that shone for you in other days
now coldly meet your own in passing gaze
to know that what has been no more shall be
to know that youth has fled far down the past
to feel that hope will ne'er again be born
and love is but a poor worn cheat at last
it is all this yet not for this to grieve
to live and heed not that one lives forlorn
nay friend farewell for if i loved you
it might be i should strive to hold you
in bonds of friendship you had long
and play the tyrant where i hoped to
yet since my love still pleads i fain would
once more your hand e'en while i seem to
it coldly from me with these words at
i may not keep and you may not possess
sweet friend believe me it is better so
to part while love finds yet no cause for grief
in slowly waning faith lest haply you
should one day find some flaw in me you knew
not of and i through tears should watch you go
knowing your soul in mine had lost belief
i thought because we had been friends so long
that i knew all your dear lips dared intend
before they dawned to speech our thoughts would blend
i dreamed like memories that faintly throng
your voice dwelt in me like an olden song
petal i thought from petal i could rend
the blossom of your soul and at the end
find still the same sweet fragrance i was wrong
last evening in our eyes love brimmed to birth
our friendship faded lost in passion's mist
we had been strangers only here close caught
against my heart the dim face i had sought
so long and now the only thing on earth
your piteous mouth a tremble to be kissed
last night beneath the mockery of the moon
i heard the sudden startled whisperings
of wakened birds settling their restless wings
the north east brought his word of gladness soon
and all the night with wonder was a swoon
a soul had breathed into long dreaming things
some unseen hand hovered above the strings
some cosmic chord had set the earth in tune
and when i rose i saw the bay arrayed
in her grey robe against the coming heat
a pulse awoke within the stirring street
the wattle gold upon the pavements thrown
and through the quiet of the colonnade
the smoky perfume of boronia blown
in her grey majesty of ancient stone
she queens it proudly though the sun's caress
her piteous cheeks ravished of bloom confess
and her dark eyes his bridegroom glance have know
robed in her flowing parks serene alone
she fronts the east and with the tropic stress
her smooth brow ripples into weariness
yet hers the sea for footstool and for throne
a continent predestined round her trails
the turbid squalor of her streets and dim
into the dark heat haze her domes flow up
her long lean fingers with their grey old nails
giving her thirsty lips to the cool brim
of the bronze beauty of her harbour's cup
she lies a grave disdain all her defence
too imperturbable for scorn she hears
only the murmur of the flowing years
that thunder slowly on her shores immense
and ebb away in moaning impotence
giants enduring she and time are peers
her dream hazed eyes knowing no hopes no tears
her glance a langour lidded insolence
and though the rabble of the restless west
in her deserted courts set their rash sway
she heeds them not as when the sun withdrawn
from his untarnished sky knows it distressed
by storm of weakling stars that he at dawn
will wither with one ruthless glance away
all things must fade there is for cities tall
the same tomorrow as for daffodils
time's wind that casts the seed the petal spills
grim london's ruined arches yet shall fall
back to the arms of earth a quiet pall
the mother draws over those she loves  and kills
and though brief nations vaunt their upstart wills
the nemesis of grass shall cover all
so  from a caravan to mecca bound
getting no more than one incurious glance
tremendous babylon thrice girt with walls
sick of her thousand years of arrogance
with a few tamarisks upon a mound
her epigraph upon the desert scrawls
one moment mankind rides the crested wave
a moment glorious beyond recall
and then the wave with slow and massive fall
obliterates the beauty that it gave
when discrowned king and manumitted slave
are free and equal to be slaves of all
democracies in their wide freedom brawl
and go down shouting to a common grave
so one by one the petals of the rose
shrivel and fade and all its splendour goes
back to the earth and in her arms embraced
through wintry centuries the dead seeds sleep
till spring comes troubling them and they unleap
once more their petals on the world to waste
he sits upon the kingly head doth rest
the round balled wimple and the heavy rings
touch on the shoulders where the swallow clings
the downward garment shows the ambiguous breast
the face  that face one scarce can look on lest
one learn the secret of unspeakable things
but the dread gaze descends with shudderings
to the veiled couched knees the hands and thumbs close pressed
o lidded downcast eyes that bear the weight
of all our woes and terrible wrong's increase
proud nostrils lips proud perfecter than these
with what a soul within you do you wait
disdain and pity love late born of hate
passion eternal patience pride and peace
o portugal whene'er i see thy name
what proud emotions rise within my breast
to thee i owe  from thee derive that fame
which here may linger when i lie at rest
when as a youth i landed on thy shore
how little did i think i e'er could be
worthy the honours thou hast giv'n to me
and when the coming storm i did deplore
drove me far from thee by its hostile threat
with feelings which can never be effaced
i learn'd to commune with those writers old
who had the deeds of thy great chieftains told
departed bards in converse sweet i met
i'd seen where they had liv'd  the land camoens grac'd
fate seek me out some lake far off and lone
shut in by hills of green and gradual rise
and beautified with blue inverted skies
where not a breeze but comes with softened tone
and if the waves awake they only moan
with a low lulling music like the rills
that make their home among those happy hills
and let me find  left there by hands unknown
a bark with mouldering sides and rifted sail
just strong enough to bear me from the shore
but not to reach its tree girt harbour more
oh happy happy rest oh world of wail
how calmly i would tempt the peaceful deep
and sink to death as if i sank to sleep
the wise ulysses honored once of kings
when he a beggar sat at his own gate
had still three friends who loved him as when great
and each to man like his own shadow clings
no change in them from change of fortune springs
wealth poverty lofty or low estate
fame infamy by his own faults or fate
these all they look on as indifferent things
ill treatment sours not them  harsh words are breath
or still they love even if they moan and mope
and will be parted from him but by death
cheerfully he may with misfortune cope
and find some flowers even in life's dreariest path
who still has left his wife  his dog  and hope
with heat and cold i feel the spiteful fiend
to work one mischief by two contraries
with lust he doth me scorch with languor freeze
but lust and languor both one christ offend
let contraries with contraries contend
let fear of blame and love of christ arise
hot love of christ to melt in tears mine eyes
cold fear of just reproach my shame to extend
that shame with heat may cool my looser thought
and tears with cold heat my heart's sluggish deep
o happy i if that such grace were wrought
till then shame blush because tears cannot weep
and tears weep you because shame cannot blush
till shame from tears and tears from shame do flush
my friends whose kindness doth their judgments blind
know you say they the dangers where you run
which zeal hides from you but compassion
tells us you feel the blow the smart we find
i know it well and as i call to mind
this is the bill dearness affection
friends fortune pleasure fame hope life undone
want prison torment death shame  what behind
is then my sense transel'mented to steel
that neither this nor that nor all can feel
nor can it bend my mind which theirs doth break
not so nor so for i am not insensate
but feel a double grief that for christ's sake
i have no more to spend nor have spent that
lord i have left all and myself behind
my state my hopes my strength and present ease
my unprovokegraved studies' sweet disease
and touch of nature and engrafted kind
whose cleaving twist doth distant tempers bind
and gentle sense of kindness that doth praise
the earnest judgments others' wills to please
all and myself i leave thy love to find
o strike my heart with lightning from above
that from one wound both fire and blood may spring
fire to transelement my soul to love
and blood as oil to keep the fire burning
that fire may draw forth blood blood extend fire
desire possession possession desire
the night the starless night of passion
from heaven began on heaven beneath to fall
when christ did sound the onset martial
a sacred hymn upon his foes to run
that with the fiery contemplation
of love and joy his soul and senses all
surcharged might not dread the bitter thrall
of pain and grief and torments all in one
then since my holy vows have undertook
to take the portrait of christ's death in me
then let my love with sonnets fill this book
with hymns to give the onset as did he
that thoughts inflamegraved with such heavenly muse
the coldest ice of fire may not refuse
over the brook of cedron christ is gone
to entertain the combat with his death
where david fled beforetime void of breath
to scape the treacheries of absalon
go let us follow him in passion
over this brook this world that walloweth
a stream of cares that drown our thoughts beneath
and wash away all resolution
beyond the world he must be passegraved clear
that in the world for christ will troubles bear
leave we o leave we then this miry flood
friends pleasures and unfaithful good
now we are up now down but cannot stand
we sink we reel jesu stretch forth thy hand
up to mount olivet my soul ascend
the mount spiritual and there supply
thy fainting lamp with oil of charity
to make the light of faith the more extend
go by this tract which thither right doth tend
which christ did first beat forth to walk thereby
and sixteen ages of posterity
have gone it over since from end to end
but strike not down to any new found balk
which hunters have begun of late to chalk
for whether 'twere the glow worm faith went out
or want of love did pine them in the way
or else the cruel devils rob or slay
no news comes back of one of all that rout
though all forsake thee lord yet i will die
for i have chainegraved so my will to thine
that i have no will left my will to untwine
but will abide with thee most willingly
though all forsake thee lord yet cannot i
for love hath wrought in me thy form divine
that thou art more my heart than heart is mine
how can i then from myself thyself fly
thus thought saint peter and thus thinking fell
and by his fall did warn us not to swell
yet still in love i say i would not fall
and say in hope i trust i never shall
but cannot say in faith what might i do
to learn to say it by hearing christ say so
jesus is risen from the infernal mire
but who art thou that say'st jesus arose
such holy words are only fit for those
whose souls with christ above the heavens aspire
but if thou hast not raisegraved thy desire
from earth to heaven but in the world dost close
thy love which unto heaven thou shouldst dispose
say not that christ is yet ascended higher
but yet within thy heart he lieth dead
and by the devil is impoisonegraved
rejoice not then in vain of his ascent
for as his glorious rise doth much augment
all good men's hopes so unto those that tread
false paths it is a dreadful argument
the earth which in delicious paradise
did bud forth man like cedars stately tall
from barren womb accursegraved by the fall
doth thrust forth man as thorns in armeagraved wise
darting the points of sin against the skies
with those thorns plaited was christ's coronal
which crowned him then with grief but after all
in heaven shall crown him crown themselves with glory
for with the purple tincture of his blood
which out the furrows of his brows did rain
he hath transformed us thorns from baser wood
to raise our nature and odoacuterant strain
that we who with our thorny sins did wound him
hereafter should with roseal virtues crown him
eternity the womb of things created
the endless bottom of duration
whose half was always past yet unbegun
and half behind still coming unabated
whose thread conjoinegraved both unseparated
is time which dated is by motion
eternity whose real thoughts are one
with god that is everness actuated
o tie my soul unto this endless clew
that i may overfathom fate and time
in all my actions which i do pursue
and bound my thoughts in that unbounded clime
for soul and thoughts designs and acts are evil
that under compass of this life do level
the first beginning of creation
was god the end thereof in man was set
end and beginning were together met
so god and man became one person
thus nature's circle as a ring doth run
christ is the pale within whose circulet
the seal of the divinity is knit
which seal doth stand the godhead's ring upon
so stand two rings upon one diamond
the knot of both and either where are met
finite and infinite more and one
alpha and omega in that fair tablet
wherein is drawn the angels' alphabet
jesus if he were learnt need more be known
o wretched man the knot of contraries
in whom both heaven and earth doth move and rest
heaven of my mind which with christ's love is blest
death of my heart which in dull languor lies
yet doth my moving will still circulize
my heaven about my earth with thoughts' unrest
where reason as a sun from east to west
darteth his shining beams to melt this ice
and now with fear it southward doth descend
now between both is equinoctial
and now to joys it higher doth ascend
and yet continues my sea glacial
what shall i do but pray to christ the son
in earth as heaven lord let thy will be done
there's silent grandeur in the boundless waste
of ocean's bosom when the winds are still
and quiet beauty like the moonbeam traced
in lengthened shadows on some snow clad hill
there's fiercer grandeur in the chainless sea
when the storm spirit wakes it from its rest
and the high waves are dashing wild and free
as the white foam they bear upon their breast
the thunder's voice is louder on the sea
the lightning flashes with a wilder glare
and landsmen know not of the dangers he
whose home is on the ocean's wave must dare
yet it is pictured in its mighty roar
and in the wrecks which strew the rock bound shore
if i have ever told you all my heart
was yours and perfect was the love it bore
believe it not  for in the time past o'er
i like some world wide traveler would start
and gaze astonished where the mountains part
thinking of mountain peaks beyond no more
as dimly climbing from the heaven's blue shore
on loftier heights the splendor falls athwart
so while i dream all perfect is the bliss
which years have added to my soul in thine
and say here must be the eternal bound
lo in my heart some thought of thee doth kiss
into clear light that undetermined line
which hovers on the heaven of love profound
that thou art high above me i have found
full oft when all alone my heavy brain
turns from itself to thee my thoughts regain
a place so far beyond their usual bound
i know they climb of other stairs the round
than those which their aspiring flights restrain
in this dull house of clay come not in vain
thy height shall raise me from this lifeless ground
let me from thine my lampless way rewin
usurp this empty falling tenement
with ruin underset o'erhung by night
replenish it with all that once has been
when all it had or wished thy presence lent
and love trimmed fresh the intellectual light
rest hunted spirit canst thou never sleep
ah when the ghouls and vampires of the press
vex all thy tender soul in wantonness
canst thou know aught of peace but still must weep
what shall thy heart's rich blood poured out so deep
be made a merchandise without redress
nor any voice the world's base deed confess
which prints and sells a poet's love so cheap
my curse upon this prying prurient age
and curst the eyes not closed in angry shame
for him whom english air and critic pen
twice baffled ere his splendid youthful gage
had measured half the heaven of love and fame
this shameless book has murdered once again
who nearer nature's life would truly come
must nearer come to him of whom i speak
he all kinds knew  the vocal and the dumb
masterful in genius was he and unique
patient sagacious tender frolicsome
this concord pan would oft his whistle take
and forth from wood and fen field hill and lake
trooping around him in their several guise
the shy inhabitants their haunts forsake
then he like Æsop man would satirize
hold up the image wild to clearest view
of undiscerning manhood's puzzled eyes
and mocking say lo mirrors here for you
be true as these if ye would be more wise
mean are all titles of nobility
and kins poor spendthrifts while i do compare
the wealth she daily lavishes on me
of love the noble kingdom that i share
is it the jealous year for emphasis
sheds beauteous sunshine and refreshing dews
my maiden's mouth doth softlier court and kiss
tint springtime's virgin cheek with rosier hues
fly faster o'er my page impassioned quill
signing this note of mine with tenderer touch
say i no measure find to mete my will
say that i love but cannot tell how much
let time and trouble the full story tell
i cannot love thee more i know i love thee well
when i remember with what buoyant heart
midst war's alarms and woes of civil strife
in youthful eagerness thou didst depart
at peril of thy safety peace and life
to nurse the wounded soldier swathe the dead
how piercèd soon by fever's poisoned dart
and brought unconscious home with 'wildered head
though ever since mid languor and dull pain
to conquer fortune cherish kindred dear
hast with grave studies vexed a sprightly brain
in myriad households kindled love and cheer
ne'er from thyself by fame's lound trump beguiled
sounding in this and the farther hemisphere
i press thee to my heart as duty's faithful child
his harp is silent shall successors rise
touching with venturous hand the trembling string
kindle glad raptures visions of surprise
and wake to ecstasy each slumbering thing
shall life and thought flash new in wondering eyes
as when the seer transcendant sweet and wise
world wide his native melodies did sing
flushed with fair hopes and ancient memories
ah no that matchless lyre shall silent lie
none hath the vanished minstrel's wondrous skill
to touch that instrument with art and will
with him winged poesy doth droop and die
while our dull age left voiceless must lament
the bard high heaven had for its service sent
while men pay reverence to mighty things
they must revere thee thou blue cinctured isle
of england—not to day but this long while
in front of nations mother of great kings
soldiers and poets round thee the sea flings
his steel bright arm and shields thee from the guile
and hurt of france secure with august smile
thou sittest and the east its tribute brings
some say thy old time power is on the wane
thy moon of grandeur filled contracts at length—
they see it darkening down from less to less
let but a hostile hand make threat again
and they shall see thee in thy ancient strength
each iron sinew quivering lioness
fantastic sleep is busy with my eyes
i seem in some waste solitude to stand
once ruled of cheops upon either hand
a dark illimitable desert lies
sultry and still—a realm of mysteries
a wide browed sphinx half buried in the sand
with orbless sockets stares across the land
the woefulest thing beneath these brooding skies
where all is woeful weird lit vacancy
'tis neither midnight twilight nor moonrise
lo while i gaze beyond the vast sand sea
the nebulous clouds are downward slowly drawn
and one bleared star faint glimmering like a bee
is shut in the rosy outstretched hand of dawn
enamoured architect of airy rhyme
build as thou wilt heed not what each man says
good souls but innocent of dreamers' ways
will come and marvel why thou wastest time
others beholding how thy turrets climb
'twixt theirs and heaven will hate thee all their days
but most beware of those who come to praise
o wondersmith o worker in sublime
and heaven sent dreams let art be all in all
build as thou wilt unspoiled by praise or blame
build as thou wilt and as thy light is given
then if at last the airy structure fall
dissolve and vanish—take thyself no shame
they fail and they alone who have not striven
sick of myself and all that keeps the light
of the blue skies away from me and mine
i climb this ledge and by this wind swept pine
lingering watch the coming of the night
'tis ever a new wonder to my sight
men look to god for some mysterious sign
for other stars than those that nightly shine
for some unnatural symbol of his might—
would'st see a miracle as grand as those
the prophets wrought of old in palestine
come watch with me the shaft of fire that glows
in yonder west the fair frail palaces
the fading alps and archipelagoes
and great cloud continents of sunset seas
the increasing moonlight drifts across my bed
and on the churchyard by the road i know
it falls as white and noiselessly as snow
'twas such a night two weary summers fled
the stars as now were waning overhead
listen again the shrill lipped bugles blow
where the swift currents of the river flow
past fredericksburg—far off the heavens are red
with sudden conflagration on yon height
linstock in hand the gunners hold their breath
a signal rocket pierces the dense night
flings its spent stars upon the town beneath
hark—the artillery massing on the right
hark—the black squadrons wheeling down to death
touched with the delicate green of early may
or later when the rose unveils her face
the world hangs glittering in star strown space
fresh as a jewel found but yesterday
and yet 'tis very old what tongue may say
how old it is race follows upon race
forgetting and forgotten in their place
sink tower and temple nothing long may stay
we build on tombs and live our day and die
from out our dust new towers and temples start
our very name becomes a mystery
what cities no man ever heard of lie
under the glacier in the mountain's heart
in violet glooms beneath the moaning sea
when i behold what pleasure is pursuit
what life what glorious eagerness it is
then mark how full possession falls from this
how fairer seems the blossom than the fruit—
i am perplexed and often stricken mute
wondering which attained the higher bliss
the wingéd insect or the chrysalis
it thrust aside with unreluctant foot
spirit of verse which still eludes my art
you shapes of loveliness that still do haunt me
o never never rest upon my heart
if when i have thee i shall little want thee
still flit away in moonlight rain and dew
will o' the wisp that i may still pursue
when to soft sleep we give ourselves away
and in a dream as in a fairy bark
drift on and on through the enchanted dark
to purple daybreak little thought we pay
to that sweet bitter world we know by day
we are clean quit of it as is a lark
so high in heaven no human eye may mark
the thin swift pinion cleaving through the gray
till we awake ill fate can do no ill
the resting heart shall not take up again
the heavy load that yet must make it bleed
for this brief space the loud world's voice is still
no faintest echo of it brings us pain
how will it be when we shall sleep indeed
herewith i send you three pressed withered flowers
this one was white with golden star this blue
ascapri's wave that purple and shot through
with sunset orange where the duomo towers
in diamond air and under hanging bowers
thearno glides this faded violet grew
on landors grave from landor's heart it drew
its magic azure in the long spring hours
within the shadow of the pyrimid
of caius cestius was the daisy found
white asthe soul of keats in paradise
the pansy—there were hundreds of them hid
in the thick grass that folded shelley's mound
guarding his ashes with most lovely eyes
not of desire alone is music born
not till the musewills is our passion crowned
unsought she comes if sought but seldom found
repaying thus our longing with her scorn
hence is it poets often are forlorn
in super subtle chains of silence bound
and mid the crowds that compass them around
still dwell in isolation night and morn
withknitted brow and cheek all passion pale
showing the baffled purpose of the mind
hence is it i that find no prayers avail
to move my lyric mistress to be kind
have stolen away into this leafy dale
drawn by the flutings of the silvery wind
not in the fabled influence of some star
benign or evil do our fortunes lie
we are the arbiters of destiny
lords of the life we either make or mar
we are our own impediment and bar
to noble issues with averted eye
we let the golden moment pass us by
time's foolish spendthrifts searching wide and far
for what lies close at hand to serve our turn
we ask fair wind and favorable tide
from the dead danish sculptor let us learn
to make occasion not to be denied
against the sheer precipitous mountainside
thorwaldsen carved hislion at lucerne
i leave behind me the elm shadowed square
andcarvenportals of the silent street
and wander on with listless vagrant feet
through seaward leading alleys till the air
smells of the sea and straightway then the care
slips from my heart and life once more is sweet
at the lane's ending lie the white winged fleet
o restless fancy whither wouldst thou fare
here are brave pinions that shall take thee far—
gaunt hulks of norway ships of red ceylon
slim masted lovers of the blue azores
'tis but an instant hence to zanzibar
or to the regions of the midnight sun
ionian isles are thine and all the fairy shores
because the sky is blue because blithe may
masks in the wren's note and the lilac's hue
because—in fine because the sky is blue
i will read none but piteous tales to day
keep happy laughter till the skies be gray
and the sad season cypress wears and rue
then when the wind is moaning in the flue
and ways are dark bid chaucer make us gay
but now a little sadness all too sweet
this springtide riot this most poignant air
this sensuous sphere of color and perfume
so listen love while i the woes repeat
of hamlet and ophelia and that pair
whose bridal bed was builded in a tomb
the smooth worn coin and threadbare classic phrase
of grecian myths that did beguile my youth
beguile me not as in the olden days
i think more grief and beauty dwell with truth
andromeda in fetters by the sea
star pale with anguish till young perseus came
less moves me with her suffering than she
the slim girl figure fettered to dark shame
that nightly haunts the park there like a shade
trailing her wretchedness from street to street
see where she passes—neither wife nor maid
how all mere fiction crumbles at her feet
here is woe's self and not the mask of woe
a legend's shadow shall not move you so
i vex me not with brooding on the years
that were ere i drew breath why should i then
distrust the darkness that may fall again
when life is done perchance in other spheres—
dead planets—i once tasted mortal tears
and walked as now among a throng of men
pondering things that lay beyond my ken
questioning death and solacing my fears
oftimes indeed strange sense have i of this
vague memories that hold me with a spell
touches of unseen lips upon my brow
breathing some incommunicable bliss
in years foregone o soul was all not well
still lovelier life awaits thee fear not thou
though i am native to this frozen zone
that half the twelvemonth torpid lies or dead
though the cold azure arching overhead
and the atlantic's never ending moan
are mine by heritage i must have known
life otherwhere in epochs long since fled
for in my veins some orient blood is red
and through my thought are lotus blossoms blown
i do remember   it was just at dusk
near a walled garden at the river's turn
a thousand summers seem but yesterday
a nubian girl more sweet than khorja musk
came to the water tank to fill her urn
and with the urn she bore my heart away
for me my friend no grave side vigil keep
with tears that memory and remorse might fill
give me your tenderest laughter earth bound still
and when i die you shall not want to weep
no epitaph for me with virtues deep
punctured in marble pitiless and chill
but when play time is over if you will
the songs that soothe beloved babes to sleep
no lenten lilies on my breast and brow
be laid when i am silent roses red
and golden roses bring me here instead
that if you love or bear me i may know
i may not know nor care when i am dead
give me your songs and flowers and laughter now
the morn is cold a whiteness newly brought
lightly and loosely powders every place
the panes among yon trees that eastward face
flash rosy fire from the opposite dawning caught—
as the face flashes with a splendid thought
as the heart flashes with a touch of grace
when heaven's light comes on ways we cannot trace
unsought yet lovelier than we ever sought
in the blue northern sky is a pale moon
through whose thin texture something doth appear
like the dark shadow of a branchy tree—
fit morning for the prayers of one like me
whose life is in midwinter and must soon
come to the shortest day of all my year
ilion along whose streets in olden days
shone that divinest form for whose sweet face
a monarch sire with all his kingly race
were too content to let their temples blaze—
where art thou now—no massive columns raise
their serried shafts to heaven we may not trace
xanthus and simois nor each storied place
round which poetic memory fondly plays
but in the verse of the old man divine
thy windy towers are built eternally
nor shall the ages as they ruin by
print on thy bulwarks one decaying sign
so true is beauty clothed in endless rhyme
so false the sensual monuments of time
if gentle stream by promised sacrifice
of kid or yearling or by scattered flowers
of votive roses culled from thy thick bowers
or golden cistus we could thee entice
to be propitious to our love no price
should save these errant flocks each nook but ours
should shed its eglantine in twinkling showers
for tribute from thy wooded paradise
but not thy flocks nor brier roses hung
in natural garlands down thy rocky hills
shall win thee to be ours more precious far
than summer blossoms or rich offerings are
we bring thee sweet poetic descants sung
to the wild music of thy tinkling rills
he went into the woods a laughing boy
each flower was in his heart the happy bird
flitting across the morning sun or heard
from wayside thicket was to him a joy
the water springs that in their moist employ
leaped from the banks with many an inward word
spoke to his soul and every leaf that stirred
found notice from his quickly glancing eye
there wondrous sleep fell on him many a year
his lids were closed youth left him and he woke
a careful noter of men's ways of clear
and lofty spirit sages when he spoke
forgot their systems and the worldly wise
shrunk from the gaze of truth with baffled eyes
had i the wondrous magic to invest
ideal forms in colour i would paint
thee winter first by an ideal saint
deep in his beads on his bare ribs should rest
a cross of lichened boughs and duly pressed
each morn by horny knees one for each bone
there should be two round hollows in the stone
whither his bent limbs should be half addressed
and in the entry of the holy cave
where the same saint should sit a laughing boy
naked and all aglow with play and joy
should peer full slily on that father grave
in the full blessedness of childhood's morn
and laugh his crusty solitude to scorn
i saw two women weeping by the tomb
of one new buried in a fair green place
bowered with shrubs—the eve retained no trace
of aught that day performed—but the faint gloom
of dying day was spread upon the sky—
the moon was broad and bright above the wood—
the distance sounded of a multitude
music and shout and mingled revelry
at length came gleaming through the thicket shade
helmet and casque—and a steel armëautd band
watched round the sepulchre in solemn stand
the night word passed from man to man conveyed
and i could see those women rise and go
under the dark trees moving sad and slow
if they were shadows walking to and fro
upon a screen you call reality
then when the light fails where do shadows go
this boy enigma rapes philosophy
but if they really occupied three square
and now are only shadows on a screen
how can the light still cast a shadow there
from shades of shadows that have never been
such questions are a mimic pantomime
of ghosts to utter nothings in dream chairs
myopia squinting in a mist of time
an eye that sees the eye with which it stares
your light too clearly shows the ancient stigma
of questions solved by posing an enigma
strange truth and beauty are enemies
treading forever on each other's toes
strange rhymes are always made of that which is
too false or silly to be said in prose
now here's a sonnet by our village poet
inscribed to kate in most romantic style
whereas  and one with half an eye might know it
he means sophronia tompkins all the while
he sings of golden curls if fiery tresses
had heat to match their hue her hair would burn
he mentions airy grace  while she possesses
a form as shapeless as an old time churn
heavens after this i never shall inquire
why people always call the poet's song a lyre
here the white ray'd anemone is born
wood sorrel and the varnish'd buttercup
and primrose in its purfled green swathed up
pallid and sweet round every budding thorn
gray ash and beech with rusty leaves outworn
here too the darting linnet hath her nest
in the blue lustred holly never shorn
whose partner cheers her little brooding breast
piping from some near bough o simple song
o cistern deep of that harmonious rillet
and these fair juicy stems that climb and throng
the vernal world and unexhausted seas
of flowing life and soul that asks to fill it
each and all of these  and more and more than these
o english mother in the ruddy glow
hugging your baby closer when outside
you see the silent soft and cruel snow
falling again and think what ills betide
unshelter'd creatures  your sad thoughts may go
where war and winter now two spectre wolves
hunt in the freezing vapour that involves
those asian peaks of ice and gulfs below
does this young soldier heed the snow that fills
his mouth and open eyes or mind in truth
to night his mother's parting syllables
ha is't a red coat  merely blood keep ruth
for others this is but an afghan youth
shot by the stranger on his native hills
i'm glad i am alive to see and feel
the full deliciousness of this bright day
that's like a heart with nothing to conceal
the young leaves scarcely trembling the blue grey
rimming the cloudless ether far away
brairds hedges shadows mountains that reveal
soft sapphire this great floor of polished steel
spread out amidst the landmarks of the bay
i stoop in sunshine to our circling net
from the black gunwale tend these milky kine
up their rough path sit by yon cottage door
plying the diligent thread take wings and soar
o hark how with the season's laureate
joy culminates in song if such a song were mine
in sussex here by shingle and by sand
flat fields and farmsteads in their wind blown trees
the shallow tide wave courses to the land
and all along the down a fringe one sees
of ducal woods that 'dim discovered spire'
is chichester where collins felt a fire
touch his sad lips thatched felpham roofs are these
where happy blake found heaven more close at hand
goodwood and arundel possess their lords
successive in the towers and groves which stay
these two poor men by some right of their own
possessed the earth and sea the sun and moon
the inner sweet of life and put in words
a personal force that doth not pass away
that which he did not feel he would not sing
what most he felt religion it was to hide
in a dumb darkling grotto where the spring
of tremulous tears arising unespied
became a holy well that durst not glide
into the day with moil or murmuring
whereto as if to some unlawful thing
he stoe musing or praying at its side
but in the sun he sang with cheerful heart
of coloured season and the whirling sphere
warm household habitude and human mirth
the whole faith blooded mystery of earth
and i who had his secret still could hear
the grotto's whisper low through every part
now autumn's fire burns slowly along the woods
and day by day the dead leaves fall and melt
and night by night the monitory blast
wails in the key hold telling how it pass'd
o'er empty fields or upland solitudes
or grim wide wave and now the power is felt
of melancholy tenderer in its moods
than any joy indulgent summer dealt
dear friends together in the glimmering eve
pensive and glad with tones that recognise
the soft invisible dew in each one's eyes
it may be somewhat thus we shall have leave
to walk with memory  when distant lies
poor earth where we were wont to live and grieve
chequer'd with woven shadows as i lay
among the grass blinking the watery gleam
i saw an echo spirit in his bay
most idly floating in the noontide beam
slow heaved his filmy skiff and fell with sway
of ocean's giant pulsing and the dream
buoyed like the young moon on a level stream
of greenish vapour at decline of day
swam airily watching the distant flocks
of sea gulls whilst a foot in careless sweep
touched the clear trembling cool with tiny shocks
faint circling till at last he dropt asleep
lull'd by the hush song of the glittering deep
lap lapping drowsily the heated rocks
the vast and solemn company of clouds
around the sun's death lit incarnadined
cool into ashy wan as night enshrouds
the level pasture creeping up behind
through voiceless vales o'er lawn and purpled hill
and hazeacuted mead her mystery to fulfil
cows low from far off farms the loitering wind
sighs in the hedge you hear it if you will
tho' all the wood alive atop with wings
lifting and sinking through the leafy nooks
seethes with the clamour of a thousand rooks
now every sound at length is hush'd away
these few are sacred moments one more day
drops in the shadowy gulf of bygone things
and thou art gone most loved most honoured friend
no never more thy gentle voice shall blend
with air of earth its pure ideal tones
binding in one as with harmonious zones
the heart and intellect and i no more
shall with thee gaze on that unfathomed deep
the human soul—as when pushed off the shore
thy mystic bark would through the darkness sweep
itself the while so bright for oft we seemed
as on some starless sea—all dark above
all dark below—yet onward as we drove
to plough up light that ever round us streamed
but he who mourns is not as one bereft
of all he loved thy living truths are left
how vast how dread o'erwhelming is the thought
of space interminable to the soul
a circling weight that crushes into naught
her mighty faculties a wondrous whole
without or parts beginning or an end
how fearful then on desperate wings to send
the fancy e'en amid the waste profound
yet born as if all daring to astound
thy giant hand o angelo hath hurled
e'en human forms with all their mortal weight
down the dread void—fall endless as their fate
already now they seem from world to world
for ages thrown yet doomed another past
another still to reach nor e'er to reach the last
o now i feel as though another sense
from heaven descending had informed my soul
i feel the pleasurable full control
of grace harmonious boundless and intense
in thee celestial group embodied lives
the subtile mystery that speaking gives
itself resolved the essences combined
of motion ceaseless unity complete
borne like a leaf by some soft eddying wind
mine eyes impelled as by enchantment sweet
from part to part with circling motion rove
yet seem unconscious of the power to move
from line to line through endless changes run
o'er countless shapes yet seem to gaze on one
full well tibaldi did thy kindred mind
the mighty spell of buonarroti own
like one who reading magic words receives
the gift of intercourse with worlds unknown
't was thine deciphering nature's mystic leaves
to hold strange converse with the viewless wind
to see the spirits in embodied forms
of gales and whirlwinds hurricanes and storms
for lo obedient to thy bidding teems
fierce into shape their stern relentless lord
his form of motion ever restless seems
or if to rest inclined his turbid soul
on hecla's top to stretch and give the word
to subject winds that sweep the desert pole
as in that twilight superstitious age
when all beyond the narrow grasp of mind
seemed fraught with meanings of supernal kind
when e'en the learned philosophic sage
wont with the stars through boundless space to range
listened with reverence to the changeling's tale—
e'en so thou strangest of all beings strange
e'en so thy visionary scenes i hail
that like the rambling of an idiot's speech
no image giving of a thing on earth
nor thought significant in reason's reach
yet in their random shadowings give birth
to thoughts and things from other worlds that come
and fill the soul and strike the reason dumb
there is a charm no vulgar mind can reach
no critic thwart no mighty master teach
a charm how mingled of the good and ill
yet still so mingled that the mystic whole
shall captive hold the struggling gazer's will
till vanquished reason own its full control
and such o rubens thy mysterious art
the charm that vexes yet enslaves the heart
thy lawless style from timid systems free
impetuous rolling like a troubled sea
high o'er the rocks of reason's lofty verge
impending hangs yet ere the foaming surge
breaks o'er the bound the refluent ebb of taste
back from the shore impels the watery waste
from one unused in pomp of words to raise
a courtly monument of empty praise
where self transpiring through the flimsy pile
betrays the builder's ostentatious guile
accept o west these unaffected lays
which genius claims and grateful justice pays
still green in age thy vigorous powers impart
the youthful freshness of a blameless heart
for thine unaided by another's pain
the wiles of envy or the sordid train
of selfishness has been the manly race
of one who felt the purifying grace
of honest fame nor found the effort vain
e'en for itself to love thy soul ennobling art
the earth has had her visitation like to this
she hath not known save when the mounting waters
made of her orb one universal ocean
for now the tree that grew in paradise
the deadly tree that first gave evil motion
and sent its poison through earth's sons and daughters
had struck again its root in every land
and now its fruit was ripe—about to fall—
and now a mighty kingdom raised the hand
to pluck and eat then from his throne stepped forth
the king of hell and stood upon the earth
but not as once upon the earth to crawl
a nation's congregated form he took
till drunk with sin and blood earth to her centre shook
what master voice shall from the dim profound
of thought evoke its fearful mighty powers—
those dread enchanters whose terrific call
may never be gainsaid whose wondrous thrall
alone the infinite the uncreate may bound
in whose dark presence e'en the reason cowers
lost in their mystery e'en while her slaves
doing her proud behests ay who to sense
shall bring them forth—those subtile powers that wear
no shape their own yet to the mind dispense
all shapes that be or who in deepest graves
seal down the crime which they shall not uptear—
those fierce avengers whom the murdered dead
shall hear and follow to the murderer's bed
a smile—alas how oft the lips that bear
this floweret of the soul but give to air
like flowering graves the growth of buried care
then drear indeed that miserable heart
where this last human boon is aye denied
if such there be it claims in man no part
whose deepest grief has yet a mirthful bride
for whose so many as the sad man's face
his joy though brief is yet reprieve from woe
the waters of his life in darkness flow
yet when the accidents of time displace
the cares that vault their channel and let in
a gleam of day with what a joyous din
the stream jets out to catch the sunny grace
o art high gift of heaven how oft defamed
when seeming praised to most a craft that fits
by dead prescriptive rule the scattered bits
of gathered knowledge even so misnamed
by some who would invoke thee but not so
by him—the noble tuscan—who gave birth
to forms unseen of man unknown to earth
now living habitants he felt the glow
of thy revealing touch that brought to view
the invisible idea and he knew
e'en by his inward sense its form was true
't was life to life responding   highest truth
so through elisha's faith the hebrew youth
beheld the thin blue air to fiery chariots grow
oh who can look on that celestial face
and kindred for it claim with aught on earth
if ever here more lovely form had birth—
no—never that supernal purity—that grace
so eloquent of unimpassioned love
that by a simple movement thus imparts
its own harmonious peace the while our hearts
rise as by instinct to the world above
and yet we look on cold unconscious stone
but what is that which thus our spirits own
as truth and life 'tis not material art—
but e'en the sculptor's soul to sense unseal'd
oh never may he doubt—its witness so reveal'd—
there lives within him an immortal part
oh that my soul a marrow bone might seize
for the old egg of my desire is broken
spilled is the pearly white and spilled the yolk and
as the mild melancholy contents grease
my path the shorn lamb baas like bumblebees
time's trashy purse is as a taken token
or like a thrilling recitation spoken
by mournful mouths filled full of mirth and cheese
and yet why should i clasp the earthful urn
or find the frittered fig that felt the fast
or choose to chase the cheese around the churn
or swallow any pill from out the past
ah no love not while your hot kisses burn
like a potato riding on the blast
if i might choose where my tired limbs shall lie
when my task here is done the oak's green crest
shall rise above my grave  a little mound
raised in some cheerful village cemetery
and i could wish that with unceasing sound
a lonely mountain rill was murmuring by
in music through the long soft twilight hours
and let the hand of her whom i love best
plant round the bright green grave those fragrant flowers
in whose deep bells the wild bee loves to rest
and should the robin from some neighbouring tree
pour his enchanted song oh softly tread
for sure if aught of earth can soothe the dead
he still must love that pensive melody
others abide our question thou art free
we ask and ask thou smilest and art still
out topping knowledge for the loftiest hill
that to the stars uncrowns his majesty
planting his stedfast footsteps in the sea
making the heaven of heavens his dwelling place
spares but the cloudy border of his base
to the foil'd searching of mortality
and thou who didst the stars and sunbeams know
self school'd self scann'd self honour'd self secure
didst walk on earth unguess'd at better so
all pains the immortal spirit must endure
all weakness that impairs all griefs that bow
find their sole voice in that victorious brow
crouch'd on the pavement close by belgrave square
a tramp i saw ill moody and tongue tied
a babe was in her arms and at her side
a girl their clothes were rags their feet were bare
some labouring men whose work lay somewhere there
pass'd opposite she touch'd her girl who hied
across and begg'd and came back satisfied
the rich she had let pass with frozen stare
thought i above her state this spirit towers
she will not ask of aliens but of friends
of sharers in a common human fate
she turns from that cold succour which attends
the unknown little from the unknowing great
and points us to a better time than ours
'twas august and the fierce sun overhead
smote on the squalid streets of bethnal green
and the pale weaver through his windows seen
in spitalfields looking thrice dispirited
i met a preacher there i knew and said
ill and o'erworked how fare you in this scene
bravely said he for i of late have been
much cheered with thoughts of christ the living bread
o human soul as long as thou canst so
set up a mark of everlasting light
above the howling senses' ebb and flow
to cheer thee and to right thee if thou roam
not with lost toil thou labourest through the night
thou mak'st the heaven thou hop'st indeed thy home
foil'd by our fellow men depress'd outworn
we leave the brutal world to take its way
and patience in another life we say
the world shall be thrust down and we up borne
and will not then the immortal armies scorn
the world's poor routed leavings or will they
who fail'd under the heat of this life's day
support the fervours of the heavenly morn
no no the energy of life may be
kept on after the grave but not begun
and he who flagg'd not in the earthly strife
from strength to strength advancing  only he
his soul well knit and all his battles won
mounts and that hardly to eternal life
god knows it i am with you  if to prize
those virtues priz'd and practis'd by too few
but priz'd but lov'd but eminent in you
man's fundamental life if to despise
the barren optimistic sophistries
of comfortable moles whom what they do
teaches the limit of the just and true
and for such doing have no need of eyes
if sadness at the long heart wasting show
wherein earth's great ones are disquieted
if thoughts not idle while before me flow
the armies of the homeless and unfed
if these are yours if this is what you are
then am i yours and what you feel i share
life is too short dear love for unkind feeling
too short for harsh reproach or bitter tone
for us should be but gentle words alone
if i have wronged you dear here let me kneeling
low at your side—in penitence appealing—
seek pardon for a fault i had not known
save that my love for you so strong had grown
it passed the bounds of reason's wise concealing
dear love by all our past of untold gladness
by every loving word and fond caress
which filled our lives with such sweet happiness
forgive forget that one brief hour of madness
then may you know the highest joy of living—
the god like peace the sweetness of forgiving
brook happy brook that glidest through my dell
that trippest with soft feet across the mead
that laughing on a mazy course dost lead
o'er pebble beds and reeds and rushy swell
go by that cottage where my love doth dwell
ripple thy sweetest ripple sing the best
of melodies thou hast lull her to rest
with such sweet tales as thou dost love to tell
say one is sitting in your wood to night
o maiden rare to catch a glimpse of you
a shadow fleet or but a window light
shall make him glad and thrill his spirit through
brook happy brook i pray go lingering
and underneath the rosy lattice sing
in deep green woods there lies a fairy glade
shut in by tawny hemlocks wild and tall
its floor is made with richest moss and all
its round is steeped in most delicious shade
it is a spot for listening silence made
few sounds awake it save the wild bird's call
and winds that murmur round its forest wall
like instruments at airy distance played
'tis there a still and stolen guest i lie
and listen to the weird wood spirits singing
i hear their bell like voices floating nigh
from arches green and dewy dingles springing
they pass in elfin song and laughter by—
i hear their clear ha ha  in deep dells ringing
thou art the friend and comrade poesy
forwhom i suffer all things still content
if not in vain for thee my light is spent—
the share of heavenly light that fell on me
thou art my meat my drink my liberty
thou art my garb thou art my tenement
wherein i hide all night from floods unpent
from lightnings winds and scourgings of the sea
oh thou art strong and lovely as the light—
yea as the light of morning strong and sweet
thou art the lover perfect in my sight
attending all my steps with eager feet
the form the image in my dreams at night
the morning glory that i rise to greet
blank shadow here the heights on either hand
sparkle with lamps around me foams the bold
loud hudson—swiftly into darkness rolled
those vanish all and memory takes her stand
in that wildcave among that famous band
girt round by unseen terrors manifold
revealed in that enchanting fiction old
blown hence through many an alien tongue and land
i see the haughty uncas and the wise
grim sagamore hear hawkeye's cheery call
the singer'sstrains of sacred sounds compact
and then i hear the holy hymn arise
from the sweetsister's lips and borne through
the plunge and tremble of the cataract
one stood upon the morning hills and saw
the heavens revealed in symbol and in sign
he read their mystic meanings line by line
and taught in light the reign of rhythmic law
one in the twilight valleys pierced with awe
beheld wan hope amid great darkness shine—
saw gloom and glory blent without design
and cried against a world of blot and flaw
sunrise and sunset poise the perfect day
one was the prince of morning fair and free
and one the lord of darkness was and they
made day and night one round of harmony
for they were kings and brothers and their sway
one law—one new divine philosophy
o winter thou art not that haggard lear
with stormy beard and countenanceof woe
raving amain or dumbly crouching low
in hoary desolation mocked with fear
to me thou art the white queen of the year
a stately virgin in her robes of snow
with royal lilies crowned and all aglow
with holy charms and gems celestial clear
nor dost thou come in barren majesty—
thou hast thy dower of sunbeams thrice refined—
nor songless but with cheerful minstrelsy
rung from the singing harpstrings of the wind
and ah with such sweet dreams such visions bright
of flowers and birds and love's divine delight
a bird with azure breast and beak of gold
a joyous
flown from far groves beneath a summer
at morn amid our march woods bare and cold
sang like a
the arches charmed and hush the
from his enamored throat flowed carelessly
in musical low
at length he ceased with arch head bent aside
and
no cheering voice of melody
only a faint call from the fields of air
swiftly he
fled to the open heavens and warbled there
on the bare cliffs in lonely revery
of billows plunging on the stubborn rocks
that pillar the ancient gateway to the sea
and there comes o'er me swift resistless free
with fire and joy exultant in the blood
erewhile through stormy years my destiny
that strong voice of the sea prophetic great
swifter than tongue of siren to enthrall
such sway hath mighty nature o'er us still
yes you have taken everything from me
beauty and love and all the measureless
impatience of proud april even our sea
shouting under the gulls all loveliness
of form and sound and colour all that we
had touched the curve of things we used to press
glowing against our senses mystery
and movement   everything taken   taken   yes
even the little brave irrelevancies
like brooding water dripping water cress
the cool dark noise of cropping cruising bees
on hot gold expeditions  even these
you took from me  oh spare me your caress
leave me at least my own stark loneliness
now do i know that love is blind for i
can see no beauty on this beauteous earth
no life no light no hopefulness no mirth
pleasure nor purpose when thou art not nigh
thy absence exiles sunshine from the sky
seres spring's maturity checks summer's birth
leaves linnet's pipe as sad as plover's cry
and makes me in abundance find but dearth
but when thy feet flutter the dark and thou
with orient eyes dawnest on my distress
suddenly sings a bird on every bough
the heavens expand the earth grows less and less
the ground is buoyant as the ether now
and all looks lovely in thy loveliness
now on the summit of love's topmost peak
kiss we and part no further can we go
and better death than we from high to low
should dwindle or decline from strong to weak
we have found all there is no more to seek
all have we proved no more is there to know
and time could only tutor us to eke
out rapture's warmth with custom's afterglow
we cannot keep at such a height as this
for even straining souls like ours inhale
but once in life so rarefied a bliss
what if we lingered till love's breath should fail
heaven of my earth one more celestial kiss
then down by separate pathways to the vale
the leaves have not yet gone then why do ye come
o white flakes falling from a dusky cloud
but yesterday my garden plot was proud
with uncut sheaves of ripe chrysanthemum
some trees the winds have stripped but look on some
'neath double load of snow and foliage bowed
unnatural winter fashioning a shroud
for autumn's burial ere its pulse be numb
yet nature plays not an inhuman part
in her our own vicissitudes we trace
do we not cling to our accustomed place
though journeying death have beckoned us to start
and faded smiles oft linger in the face
while grief's first flakes fall silent on the heart
within the hollow silence of the night
i lay awake and listened i could hear
planet with punctual planet chiming clear
and unto star star cadencing aright
nor these alone cloistered from deafening sight
all things that are made music to my ear
hushed woods dumb caves and many a soundless mere
with arctic mains in rigid sleep locked tight
but ever with this chant from shore and sea
from singing constellation humming thought
and life through time's stops blowing variously
a melancholy undertone was wrought
and from its boundless prison house i caught
the awful wail of lone eternity
now upon english soil i soon shall stand
homeward from climes that fancy deems more fair
and well i know that there will greet me there
no soft foam fawning upon smiling strand
no scent of orange groves no zephyrs bland
but amazonian march with breast half bare
and sleety arrows whistling through the air
will be my welcome from that burly land
yet he who boasts his birth place yonder lies
owns in his heart a mood akin to scorn
for sensuous slopes that bask 'neath southern skies
teeming with wine and prodigal of corn
and gazing through the mist with misty eyes
blesses the brave bleak land where he was born
when acorns fall and swallows troop for flight
and hope matured slow mellows to regret
and autumn pressed by winter for his debt
drops leaf on leaf till she be beggared quite
should then the crescent moon's unselfish light
gleam up the sky just as the sun doth set
her brightening gaze though day and dark have met
prolongs the gloaming and retards the night
so fair young life new risen upon mine
just as it owns the edict of decay
and fancy's fires should pale and pass away
my menaced glory takes a glow from thine
and in the deepening sundown of my day
thou with thy dawn delayest my decline
let others sing of mars and of his train
of great exploits and honourable scars
the many dire effects of civil wars
death's triumphs and encomiums of the slain
i sing the conflicts i myself sustain
with her great love the cause of all my cares
who wounds with looks and fetters with her hairs
this mournful tale requires a tragic strain
eyes were the arms did first my peace control
wounded by them a source of tears there sprung
running like blood from my afflicted soul
thou love to whom this conquest does belong
leave me at least the comfort to condole
and as thou wound'st my heart inspire my song
o love who in my breast's most noble part
didst that fair image lodge that form divine
in whom the sum of heavenly graces shine
and there ingrav'dst it with thy golden dart
now mighty workman help me by thy art
since my dull pen trembles to strike a line
that i on paper copy the design
by thee express'd so lively in my heart
lend me when i this great attempt do try
a feather from thy wings that whilst to write
my hand's employ'd my thoughts may soar on high
thy torch which fires our hearts and burns so bright
my darker fancy let its flame supply
and through my numbers dart celestial light
now angry juno sends from heaven in spite
rivers and seas instead of moderate showers
horror invests the world and the bright hours
of delos' god are chang'd to dismal night
so crowds of anxious thoughts on ev'ry side
invade my soul and through my restless eyes
i shed such streams of tears my heart e'en tries
death's pangs whilst i by force in life abide
but the brisk gales which rising by and by
where sol at night in thetis' lap shall lie
will make heaven clear and drive away the rain
ah cynthia that the blasts or sighs i vent
could ease my breast of cloudy discontent
which still with fresh assaults renews my pain
come all ye wits that with immortal rhymes
glory to others and yourselves create
and you that gratify the future times
whilst tales of love and battles ye relate
come turn your studies and your eyes this way
this theme will crown your heads with lasting bays
'tis cynthia's beauty heavenly cynthia
come swell your volumes all with cynthia's praise
posterity will then your works admire
and for her sake shall them as jewels prize
all things to cynthia's glory must conspire
she shall be worshipp'd with the deities
to her make foreign lands pay honours due
thus shall you live by her and she by you
fair cynthia mounted on her sprightly pad
which in white robe with silver fringe was clad
and swift as wind his graceful steps did move
as with his beauteous guide he'd been in love
though fierce yet humble still to her command
obeying ev'ry touch of her fair hand
her golden bit his foaming mouth did check
it spread his crest and rais'd his bending neck
she was the rose upon this hill of snow
her sparkling beauty made the glorious show
whence secret flames men in their bosoms took
the graces and the cupids her surround
attending her while cruel she does wound
with switch her horse and hearts with ev'ry look
whate'er the world could boast of fair or good
thy back with pride has borne thou happy horse
by which thou'rt fall'n in middle of thy course
too feeble to sustain so great a load
oh happy fall oh dying full of bliss
whilst she that guided love did guide thy head
big with this thought thou willingly art dead
scorning another burden after this
a heaven of beauty over press'd thy back
this might have made alcides' shoulders crack
and atlas truckle under such a weight
heav'n thee amongst its horses long'd to see
as here the world was late in love with thee
when carrying her who to the sun gave light
if love it be not what is this i feel
if it be love what love is fain i'd know
if good why the effects severe and ill
if bad why do its torments please me so
if willingly i burn should i complain
if 'gainst my will what helps it to lament
oh living death oh most delightful pain
how comes all this if i do not consent
if i consent 'tis madness then to grieve
amidst these storms in a weak boat i'm tost
upon a dangerous sea without relief
no help from reason but in error lost
which way in this distraction shall i turn
that freeze in summer and in winter burn
barefoot and ragged with neglected hair
she whom the heavens at once made poor and fair
with humble voice and moving words did stay
to beg an alms of all who pass'd that way
but thousands viewing her became her prize
willingly yielding to her conquering eyes
and caught by her bright hairs whilst careless she
makes them pay homage to her poverty
so mean a boon said i what can extort
from that fair mouth where wanton love to sport
amidst the pearls and rubies we behold
nature on thee has all her treasures spread
do but incline thy rich and precious head
and those fair locks shall pour down showers of gold
since cruel thyrsis you my torments slight
and take no notice of my amorous flame
in these vermilion letters thus i write
my bloody reasons to confirm the same
these of my passion are the lively marks
which from my veins you here in blood see writ
touch them your breast will kindle with the sparks
the ardent characters are reeking yet
nor can my pen alone my heart explain
my very soul o'ercharg'd with grief i fain
would send enclos'd herein the truth to prove
and if i've been too sparing of my blood
this is the reason why i stopp'd the flood
i would not spoil the face i'd have you love
courted by cupids and the amorous air
upon a shady throne at her repose
she sate than whom none e'er so sweet or fair
it was the queen of flowers the blushing rose
with no less pride upon his bed of state
a lily pale with envy look'd that way
with humble flowers encompass'd round he sate
and scorn'd the sceptre at her feet to lay
to arms with thorns and prickles they prepare
and each designs to try it out by war
till on good counsel they in rule combine
so in your face the lovely white and red
cynthia i see all quarrels banisheacuted
and rose and lily do in empire join
if theban pindar rais'd his country's fame
whilst its great deeds he does in odes rehearse
and they made greater by his noble verse
in gratitude are trophies to his name
then english pindar shall for ever live
since his divine and lofty poetry
secur'd great regglo by thy harmony
shall to itself immortal glory give
the world's amaz'd to hear the sweet consent
betwixt thy charming voice and instrument
they'd stop the bays which from apollo fled
thy skilful notes would make in full career
phoebus the god of music stay to hear
and with his daphne crown thy rival head
you who to fam'd guarini now he's dead
your verses consecrate and statues rear
for that sweet padan swan your tears have shed
sweetest that ever did or will sing here
behold this picture on his fun'ral pile
your mournful spirits 'twill with joy revive
tho' th' artist cheats your senses all the while
for 'tis but paint which you would swear does live
this serves to keep our friend in memory
since death hath robb'd us of his better part
and that he so might live as ne'er to die
he drew himself too but with diff'rent art
judge which with greatest life and spirit looks
borgianni's painting or guarini's books
i make no war and yet no peace have found
with heat i melt when starv'd to death with cold
i soar to heav'n while grovelling on the ground
embrace the world yet nothing do i hold
i'm not confin'd yet cannot i depart
nor loose the chain tho' not a captive led
love kills me not yet wounds me to the heart
will neither have m' alive nor have me dead
being blind i see not having voice i cry
i wish for death while i of life make choice
i hate myself yet love you tenderly
do feed of tears and in my grief rejoice
thus cynthia all my health is but disease
both life and death do equally displease
i to love's garden came with my attire
was wove with herbs of hope and of desire
branches of trouble too by me were worn
whose flowers and fruit were prejudice and scorn
'twas wall'd with pain and anguish round about
and from a thousand places issu'd out
water of grief and air of sighs beside
deceit and cruelty did there reside
pride was the keeper and to cultivate
was jealousy who still with mortal hate
tare up my happiness ere it could grow
whilst like a madman thus i strive to sow
under the shadow of a thought that's kind
i plough in stone dig water stop the wind
i fill with sighs the air whene'er i stand
on yon' high hill and thence survey the plain
where laura she who could my heart command
did in her earthly paradise remain
for now she's dead and left me here alone
griev'd for her loss that i could gladly die
drowning my eyes in making of my moan
my tears have left no space about me dry
there is no stone upon that craggy hill
nor these sweet fields an herb or plant do bring
nor flower 'mongst all that do the valleys fill
nor any drop of water from the spring
nor beasts so wild that in the woods do dwell
but of my grief for laura's death can tell
oh death without regard to wrong or right
all things at will thy boundless rage devours
this tender plant thou hast cut down in spight
and scatter'd on the ground its fruit and flowers
our love's extinct that with such ardour burn'd
and all my hope of future pleasure dies
nature's chief master piece to earth's return'd
deaf to my passion and my grievous cries
sylvia the tears which on thy sepulchre
hereafter shall be shed or those now are
tho' fruitless yet i offer them to thee
until the coming of th' eternal night
shall close these eyes once happy with thy sight
and give me eyes with which i thee may see
o time oh rolling heavens that fly so fast
and cheat us mortals ignorant and blind
oh fugitive day swifter than bird or wind
your frauds i see by all my suff'rings past
but pardon me 'tis i myself must blame
nature that spreads your wings and makes you fly
to me gave eyes that i my ills might spy
yet i retain'd them to my grief and shame
time was i might and time is still i may
direct my steps in a securer way
and end this sad infinity of ill
yet 'tis not from thy yoke o love i part
but the effects i will reclaim my heart
virtue's no chance but is acquir'd by skill
vile composition earth inspir'd with breath
man that at first wert made of dust and tears
and then by law divine condemn'd to death
when wilt thou check thy lusts in their careers
change all thy mirth to sorrow and repent
that thou so often didst just heav'n offend
deplore thy precious hours so vainly spent
if thou wilt 'scape such pains as have no end
the gaping grave expects thee as its right
'tis a strait place but can contain with ease
honour command wealth beauty and delight
and all that does our carnal senses please
only th' immortal soul can never die
therefore on that thy utmost care employ
th' unruly steed by laws to tame and ride
with graceful course the well pois'd lance to guide
in martial sports ever to win the prize
and troops with skill and judgement exercise
in a calm breast a warlike heart to show
to glory friend to wantonness a foe
to keep on passion reason's powerful hand
over his soul and self to have command
to sport with books whilst arms aside he lays
to interweave the olive with the bays
when tir'd with arts to tune apollo's lyre
to merit honours ere he them desire
these fruits which others bring with art and time
your blooming age does yield before your prime
will spurs me on love wounds me with his dart
pleasure does draw me custom pulls me too
hope flatters that i should my ends pursue
and lends her right hand to my fainting heart
my wretched heart accepts nor yet espies
the weakness of my blind disloyal guide
my passions rule long since my reason died
and from one fond desire still others rise
virtue and wealth beauty and graceful mien
sweet words and person fair as e'er was seen
were the allurements drew me to her net
'twas thirteen hundred twenty sev'n the year
april the sixth this nymph did first appear
and tied me so i ne'er shall freedom get
pleasure in thought in weeping ease i find
i catch at shadows grasp air with my hand
on seas i float are bounded with no land
plough water sow on rocks and reap the wind
the sun i gaz'd so long at i became
struck with its dazzling rays and lost my eyes
i chase a nimble doe that always flies
and hunt with a dull creature weak and lame
heartless i live to all things but my ill
which i'm solicitous to follow still
and only call on laura love and death
thus twenty years i've spent in misery
whilst only sighs and tears and sobs i buy
under such hard stars first i drew my breath
oh eyes our sun's extinct and at an end
or rather glorified in heav'n does shine
there shall we see her there does she attend
and at our long delay perchance repine
alas my ears the voice you lov'd to hear
is now rais'd up to the celestial choir
and you my feet she's gone that us'd to steer
your course where you till death can ne'er aspire
cannot my soul nor body yet be free
'twas not my fault you this occasion lost
that seeing hearing finding her y' are crost
blame death or rather blest be ever he
who binds and looses makes and can destroy
and when life's done crowns with eternal joy
this nightingale that does so much complain
robb'd of her tender young or dearest mate
and to the fields and heav'ns her tale relate
in such sad notes but yet harmonious strain
perhaps this station kindly does retain
to join her griefs with my unhappy state
'twas my assurance did my woe create
i thought death could not have a goddess slain
how soon deceiv'd are those who least mistrust
i ne'er could think that face should turn to dust
which than all human beauties seem'd more pure
but now i find that my malicious fate
will to my sorrow have me learn too late
nothing that pleases here can long endure
hold treacherous thoughts that dare my rule despise
is 't not enough 'gainst me in war are join'd
love fortune and grim death but i must find
within me such domestic enemies
and thou my heart that dost my peace oppose
disloyal thou wilt give my soul no rest
but harb'ring still these thoughts within my breast
keep'st correspondence with my deadly foes
to thee love all his messages conveys
fortune my now departed pomp displays
death in my mind does all my griefs express
that my remains fall by necessity
my thoughts with errors arm themselves in thee
thou art the cause of my unhappiness
why idol of my heart these mournful cries
and so much grief on those fair cheeks appears
from whence proceed those envious showers of tears
dark'ning the lustre of thy beauteous eyes
how dares hold sorrow labour to remove
so many graces from their proper place
ah cynthia pain endeavours in thy face
to poison all the sweetest charms of love
sense of thy grief my soul with anguish fills
which out of pity into tears distills
and for thy ease would fain endure thy woe
but this affliction sure thy heart sustains
that cruel thou being sensible of pains
may'st to thy constant martyr pity show
near a cool fountain on a rose bed lay
my cynthia sleeping in the open air
whom sol espied and seeing her so fair
gaz'd till his wanton coursers lost their way
the proudest flowers were not asham'd to find
their scent and colour rivall'd in her face
her bright curl'd hairs were toss'd from place to place
on neck and bosom by the amorous wind
her smiles were animated by her breath
which still as soon as born receiv'd their death
being mortal made in pity to men's hearts
poor lovers then did lie and take their rest
for the blind boy who does our peace molest
had in her sleeping eyes hid all his darts
i lov'd thee faithless man and love thee still
thou fatal object of my fond desires
and that which nourishes these amorous fires
is hope by which i love against my will
great was the passion thou didst late express
yet scorn'st me now whom long thou didst adore
sporting with others her thou mind'st no more
whom thou hast call'd thy heav'n and happiness
think not by this thy lesbia thee invites
to spend thy years in dalliance and delights
'tis but to keep her faith in memory
but if to grieve my soul thou only strive
to thy reproach and to my boast i'll live
a monument of thy inconstancy
with hairs which for the wind to play with hung
with her torn garments and with naked feet
fair lydia dancing went from street to street
singing with pleasant voice her foolish song
on her she drew all eyes in ev'ry place
and them to pity by her pranks did move
which turn'd with gazing longer into love
by the rare beauty of her charming face
in all her frenzies and her mimicries
while she did nature's richest gifts despise
there active love did subt'ly play his part
her antic postures made her look more gay
her ragged clothes her treasures did display
and with each motion she ensnar'd a heart
unhappy i came from my mother's womb
as she oh blessed she who gave me breath
having receiv'd the fatal stroke of death
by weeping friends was carried to her tomb
the sorrow i exprest and grievous cries
love's tribute were for her to heav'n was gone
my coffin and my cradle both were one
and at her sunset mine began to rise
wretch how i quake to think on that sad day
which both for life and death at once made way
being gave the son and mother turn'd to earth
alas i die not that life hastes so fast
but that to me each minute seems the last
for i in death's cold arms receiv'd my birth
i dreamt by me i saw fair venus stand
holding young cupid in her lovely hand
and said kind shepherd i a scholar bring
my little son to learn of you to sing
then went away and i to gain her praise
would fain have taught him all my rural lays
how pan found out the pipe pallas the flute
phoebus the harp and mercury the lute
these were my subjects which he still would slight
and fill my ears with love songs day and night
of mortals and of gods what tricks they us'd
and how his mother venus them abus'd
so i forgot my pupil to improve
and learn'd of him by songs the art of love
chaste cynthia bids me love but hope no more
ne'er with enjoyment  which i still have strove
t' obey and ev'ry looser thought reprove
without desiring her i her adore
what human passion does with tears implore
the intellect enjoys when 'tis in love
with the eternal soul which here does move
in mortal closet where 'tis kept in store
our souls are in one mutual knot combin'd
not common passion dull and unrefin'd
our flame ascends that smothers here below
the body made of earth turns to the same
as soul t' eternity from whence it came
my love's immortal then and mistress too
help help ye nymphs whilst on the neighb'ring plain
your flocks do feed come and assistance bring
alas fair cynthia's sick and languishing
for whom my heart endures a greater pain
ye syrens of the thames let all your train
tune their shrill instruments and to them sing
and let its flow'ry banks with echoes ring
this may her wonted cheerful looks regain
ye herbs that richest med'cines can produce
come quickly and afford such sov'reign juice
as from her heart may all the pains remove
but in her face if death would paleness give
and fate ordain that she in torment live
then let her suffer in the flames of love
my hairs are hoary wrinkled is my face
i lose my strength and all my manly grace
my eyes grow dim my teeth are broke or gone
and the best part of all my life is done
i'm drown'd in cares and often sigh and weep
my spirits fail me broken is my sleep
thoughts of the gaping grave distract my head
for in its paths 'wake or asleep we tread
none can from it by art their feet restrain
nor back tho' wide its gates can come again
then since these ills attend the life of man
let's make their burden easy as we can
cares are no cares but whilst on them we think
to clear our minds of such dull thoughts let's drink
led by kind stars one ev'ning to the grove
i spied my cynthia in the walk of love
her heav'nly voice did soon salute my ears
i heard methought the music of the spheres
those notes on all the birds had laid a spell
and list'ning 'mongst the rest was philomel
who thinking she in credit suffer'd wrong
strove tho' in vain to equal cynthia's song
but when herself in voice outdone she knew
being griev'd she ceas'd and from her rival flew
i stay'd and saw my fair walk round the tree
and sing her triumph for the victory
thus whilst my ears were feasted with delight
my eyes no less were charm'd at her angelic sight
why dost thou fly me thus oh cruel boy
i am no wolf that would thy life destroy
but a fond nymph admirer of thy face
as echo once of fair narcissus was
thou e'en in dangers dost thy fancy please
striving with toil the hunted game to seize
while wretched me who languish for thy sake
when in thy net thou dost refuse to take
but i alas in vain attempt to find
effects of pity in a hard'ned mind
as soon the hare its hunters may pursue
as i with prayers thy cruel heart subdue
my pow'r i see cannot thy steps retain
thus led by sports and wing'd by thy disdain
jove saw the sphere old archimedes made
and to the other gods he laughing said
such wondrous skill can crafty mortals get
of my great work to make the counterfeit
heav'n's and earth's constitutions fixt by fate
this syracusan's art does imitate
his various planets their just order have
keeping by springs the motions which he gave
thro' the twelve signs his sun completes its years
and each new month his mock new moon appears
pleas'd with his world this artist unconfined
boldly rules heav'n in his aspiring mind
no more salmoneus' thunder i admire
here's one has ap'd all nature's works entire
the life we strive to lengthen out
is like a feather rais'd from ground
awhile in air 'tis tost about
and almost lost as soon as found
if it continue long in sight
'tis sometimes high and sometimes low
yet proudly aims a tow'ring flight
to make the more conspicuous show
the air with ease its weight sustains
since 'tis by nature light and frail
seldom in quiet state remains
for troops of dangers it assail
and after various conflicts with its foes
it drops to earth the earth from whence it rose
no human thing in constancy will stay
the learned chian us'd of old to say
our life was frailer than the fading leaves
which man forgets and scarce its flight perceives
he harbours idle fancies in his brain
many which he from childhood did retain
and whilst his vigour lasts he's still inclin'd
to fill with trifles his unsettled mind
on age or death ne'er thinks nor takes he care
health to preserve or active limbs to spare
we to more serious things our minds should give
youth hastes and we have little time to live
to weigh this well is a material part
this thought's of worth record it in thy heart
see whilst thou weep'st fair chloe see
the world in sympathy with thee
the cheerful birds no longer sing
each drops his head and hangs his wing
the clouds have bent their bosom lower
and shed their sorrows in a shower
the brooks beyond their limits flow
and louder murmurs speak their woe
the nymphs and swains adopt thy cares
they heave thy sighs and weep thy tears
fantastic nymph that grief should move
thy heart obdurate against love
strange tears whose power can soften all
but that dear breast on which they fall
i sometimes wonder thatthe human mind
in searching for creation's hidden things
should miss that high intelligence that springs
from that which is not seen but is divined
does knowingmuch of nature make us blind
to nature's better self thegreek could see
a conscious life in every stream and tree—
some nymph or god our broader faith should find
a life divine whose fine pulsations roll
in endless surges through the secret veins
of earth and sky which hidden still remains
save to the instinct of the reverent soul
should know that everything from lowest sod
to farthest star thrills with the life of god
in a cot studded fruity green deep dale
there grows the ruin of an abbey old
and on the hillside cut in rock behold
a sainted hermit's cell so goes the tale
what of that ruin there is nothing left
save one sky framing window arch which climbs
up to its top point single stoned bereft
of prop or load  and this strange thing sublimes
the scene for the fair great house vowed to god
is hurled down and unhallowed and we tread
over buried graves which have devoured their dead
while over all springs up the green lifed sod
and arch so light and ofty in its span
so frail and yet so lasting  'tis like man
as one who hears beside a quiet shore
when seas are stilled and winds and waves are spent
faint murmurs of that vanished continent
whose storied plains reach out on ocean's floor
o'er which the dark pulsating waters pour
with sounds of bells by the swaying flood impent
tolling now lone and low now full and blent
then lost again amid the surfy roar—
so through the silent spaces of the dark
when lulls the world hum on the muffled blast
there strays a tender chord of some far strain
from time when love was sweet and hope not vain
and pulses throb and with dear longing mark
the distant echoes of a buried past
thou mad'st me sage if aught i am and skilled
to learn life's broadest arts no more i build
vain temples by forgetful fame unblest
nor madly brave some luring phantom quest
i count no fretting hopes yet unfulfilled
but know with passionate youth's wild tremor stilled
the lulling cadences of pulseless rest
the tide of time flows on still as a dream
its margin crowned with calm and presage spanned
the years enrich me as a silt fraught stream
laden with opulent spoil from many a field
gilds with its golden hoard some mellow strand
ah would this lustrum might full fruitage yield
what numerous tribes beneath thy shadowy wing
o mild and modest evening find delight
first to the grove his lingering fair to bring
the warm and youthful lover hating light
sighs oft for thee and next the boisterous string
of school imps freed from dame's all dreaded sight
round village cross in many a wanton ring
wishes thy stay then too with vasty might
from steeple's side to urge the bounding ball
the lusty hinds await thy fragrant call
i general friend by turns am joined with all
lover and elfin gay and harmless hind
nor heed the proud to real wisdom blind
so as my heart be pure and free my mind
around my porch and lonely casement spread
the myrtle never sear and gadding vine
with fragrant sweetbriar love to intertwine
and in my garden's box encircled bed
the pansy pied and musk rose white and red
the pink the lily chaste and sweet woodbine
fling odours round thick woven eglantine
decks my trim fence in which by silence led
the wren hath wisely built her mossy cell
sheltered from storms in courtly land so rife
and nestles over her young and warbles well
'tis here with innocence in peaceful glen
i pass my blameless moments far from men
nor wishing death too soon nor asking life
it is not for muse like mine in rude essay
to paint the beauties of thy classic page
which ay deserve far other patronage
than the small meed sincere she fain would pay
of verse grave eulogy or distich gay
for that thou deignst inform this sapient age
what ere was whilom told by tuneful sage
or harped in hall or bower on solemn day
but more for that thy skill the minstrel throng
forbids in cold oblivion's arms to lie
dear long lost masters of the british song
they shall requite thee better far than i
and other climes and other shades among
weave thee a laureate wreath that never shall die
cold is the senseless heart that never strove
with the mild tumult of a real flame
rugged the breast that beauty cannot tame
nor youth's enlivening graces teach to love
the pathless vale the long forsaken grove
the rocky cave that bears the fair one's name
with ivy mantled over for empty fame
let him amidst the rabble toil or rove
for plunder far to western clime
give me to waste the hours in amorous play
with delia beauteous maid or build the rhyme
praising her flowing hair her snowy arms
and all that prodigality of charms
formed to enslave my heart and grace my lay
i saw you starting for another war
the emblem of adventure and of youth
so that men trembled saying he forsooth
has gone has gone and shall return no more
and then out there they told me you were dead
taken and killed how was it that i knew
whatever else was true that was not true
and then i saw you pale upon your bed
scarcely two years ago when you were sent
back from the margin of the dim abyss
for death had sealed you with a warning kiss
and let you go to meet a nobler fate
to fight for hearth and home o fortunate
to die in battle with your regiment
oblivion is it not one name of death
nay is not lethe death's most dismal name
death growing hour by hour within our frame
death settling slowly in our brain the breath
of the soul ebbing so that he who saith
i am to day as yesterday the same
lies for his thoughts are fled like smoke from flame
and like the dew his sorrow vanisheth
changed is the river though the waves remain
which rocks of slowlier changing circumstance
plough up in every day of chafing foam
changed is the river gone gone to the main
yesterday's dream and last year's happy chance
and the heart's thoughts again return not home
a dagger hilt crusted with flaming gems
a queen's rich girdle clasped with tiger's claws
a lady's glove or a cat's velvet paws
the whisper of a judge when he condemns
fierce night shade berries purple on their stems
among the rose's healthsome scarlet haws
a rainbow sheathed snake with jagged jaws
such are queen beauty's sovran anadems
for she caresses with a poisoned hand
and venom hangs about her moistened lips
and plots of murder lurk with her eyes
she loves lewd girls dancing a saraband
the murderer stabbing till all his body drips
and thee my gentle lady and thy soft sighs
her hair is yellow as sulphur and her gaze
as brimstone burning blue and odorous
i know not how her eyes came to be thus
but i do think her soul must be ablaze
their pupils wane or wax to blame or praise
as a cat watches mice she watches us
and i am sure her claws are murderous
so feline are her velvet coaxing ways
she purrs like a young leopard soothed and pleased
at flattery so too turns and snarls when teased
and pats her love like a beast of prey
i fancy too that over wine and food
her saffron hair turns tawny and grand her mood
she broods like a young lioness of play
the marriage of two murderers in the gloom
of a dark fane to hymns of blackest night
before a priest who keeps his hands from sight
hidden away beneath his robe of doom
lest any see the flowers of blood that bloom
for gems upon the fingers red on white
the while far up in domes of dizzy height
the trumpets of the organ peal and boom
such is our love oh sweet delicious lips
from which i fancy all the world's blood drips
oh supple waist pale cheek and eyes of fire
hard little breasts and white gigantic hips
and blue black hair with serpent coils that slips
out of my hand in hours of red desire
if music and sweet poetry agree
as they must needs the sister and the brother
then must the love be great 'twixt thee and me
because thou lov'st the one and i the other
dowland to thee is dear whose heavenly touch
upon the lute doth ravish human sense
spenser to me whose deep conceit is such
as passing all conceit needs no defence
thou lov'st to hear the sweet melodious sound
that phoeligbus' lute the queen of music makes
and i in deep delight am chiefly drowned
whenas himself to singing he betakes
one god is god of both as poets feign
one knight loves both and both in thee remain
chaucer is dead and gower lies in grave
the earl of surrey long ago is gone
sir philip sidney's soul the heavens have
george gascoigne him before was tombed in stone
yet though their bodies lie full low in ground
as every thing must die that erst was born
their living fame no fortune can confound
nor ever shall their labors be forlorn
and you that discommend sweet poetry
so that the subject of the same be good
here may you see your fond simplicity
sith kings have favored it of royal blood
the king of scots now living is a poet
as his lepanto and his furies show it
sighing and sadly sitting by my love
he asked the cause of my heart's sorrowing
conjuring me by heaven's eternal king
to tell the cause which me so much did move
compelled quoth i to thee will i confess
love is the cause and only love it is
that doth deprive me of my heavenly bliss
love is the pain that doth my heart oppress
and what is she quoth he whom thou dost love
look in this glass quoth i there shalt thou see
the perfect form of my felicity
when thinking that it would strange magic prove
he opened it and taking off the cover
he straight perceived himself to be my lover
cherry lipped adonis in his snowy shape
might not compare with his pure ivory white
on whose fair front a poet's pen might write
whose rosiate red excels the crimson grape
his love enticing delicate soft limbs
are rarely framed t' intrap poor gazing eyes
his cheeks the lily and carnation dyes
with lovely tincture which apollo's dims
his lips ripe strawberries in nectar wet
his mouth a hive his tongue a honeycomb
where muses like bees make their mansion
his teeth pure pearl in blushing coral set
oh how can such a body sin procuring
be slow to love and quick to hate enduring
can i forget that glorious autumn night
so full of joyous pain when you and i
stood on the shore beneath a cloudless sky
and watched the moon all drenched with holy light
sail slowly up and toss a veil of white
across the heaving sea—when waves rode by
and pressed broad palms upon the rocks to try
and bear away the rough stone from our sight
ah no 'twas then i spoke to you of love—
my secret which you long ere that had guessed
'twas then i firstknew passion's fiery heat
and kissed your cheek your lips while high above
a great star shook and in its burning breast
as in my own a red    heart beat and beat
the old old wonder of the lengthening days
is with us once again the winter's sun
slow sinking to the west when day is done
each eve a little longer with us stays
and cheers the snowy landscape with his rays
nor do we notice what he has begun
until a month or more of days have run
when we exclaim how long the light delays
so let some kindly deed however slight
be daily done by us that to the waste
of selfishness some light it may impart—
mayhap not noticed till we feel the night
is less witihin our souls and broader spaced
has grown the cheerful sunshine of the heart
let me be blesséd for the peace i make
god grant that old shakespearean praise may glow
columbia on thy brows most royal so
girt with a crown no mortal chances break
the eagle that from ruined rome we take
hath but a pagan heart his kingdoms go
that the dove's kingdom still may come and flow
o'er all the world ere the new century wake
make straight her paths her sweet triumphal way
for not by might and power earth's sorrows cease
nor shall the stars in our young banner dim
while in its stripes is set the sign of him
who won by sufferance an eternal sway
the king of glory and the prince of peace
honor and pity for the smitten field
the valorous ranks mown down like precious corn
whose want must famish love morn after morn
till death the good physician shall have healed
the craving and the tearspent eyelids sealed
proud be the homes that for each cannon torn
encrimsoned rampart have been left forlorn
holy the knells o'er fallen patriots pealed
but they above the battle throng a space
of starry silences and silver rest
commingled ghosts they press like brothers through
white dove winged portals where one father's face
atones their passion as the ethereal blue
serenes the fiery glows of east and west
who would trust england let him lift his eyes
to nelson columned o'er trafalgar square
her hieroglyph of duty written where
the roar of traffic hushes to the skies
or mark while paul's vast shadow softly lies
on gordon's statued sleep how praise and prayer
flush through the frank young faces clustering there
to con that kindred rune of sacrifice
o england no bland cloud ship in the blue
but rough oak plunging on o'er perilous jars
of reef and ice our faith will follow you
the more for tempest roar that strains your spars
and splits your canvas be your helm but true
your courses shapen by the eternal stars
the nightmare melts at last and london wakes
to her old habit of victorious ease
more men and more and more for over seas
more guns until the giant hammer breaks
that patriot folk whom even god forsakes
shall not great england work her will on these
the foolish little nations and appease
an angry shame that in her memory aches
but far beyond the fierce contested flood
the cannon planted pass the shell torn town
the last wild carnival of fire and blood
beware beware that dim and awful shade
armored with milton's sword and cromwell's frown
affronted freedom of her own betrayed
a lonely burial ground is on cape cod
claiming the privilege of age each stone
leans as it will its scarred front overflown
with winged cherubic head by grace of god
fulfilled in nature's gentle period
all ghastly blazonry of skull and bone
muffled in moss and lichen overgrown
hath made its peace with beauty seldom trod
these grasses are where ghosts of old regret
once tended vines run wild but should a guest
stoop there this weathered epitaph to trace
'twill whisper him of all the human race
here lies beneath a heartsease coverlet
patience wife of experience at rest
an idle tree whose timber builds no ships
whose wilding growth is all unfit to trace
trim parallels in park and market place
yet precious for the fragrant dew that drips
from blowing sprays to comfort fevered lips
for lilt of hidden birds for changeful grace
of leafy shade that sunbeams interlace
for heaven's dear blue about the spiring tips
the world's great highway takes no heed of it
though paths wind thither through the april green
the earth's blind forces feel no need of it
yet was there shaped before the shaping hours
a subtle league and sympathy between
this rhythmic tree and all effectual powers
who called himself your priest immortal choir
not dante though in ruddiest altar flame
he plunged his torch and bore it through the shame
of deepening hell to domes of starry fire
in steadfast temple service not that sire
of glorious chant our milton he who came
with solemn tread and vestments purged from blame
to swing the censer of divine desire
but horace sipping at your crystal spring
as lightly as he quaffed his sabine wine
caught up that lute about whose golden string
the rose and myrtle he was deft to twine
and sweetly sang in pauses of the feast
the poet is the gods' anointed priest
hearing the autumnal wind i muse on thee
o shelley bird of most aerial note
whose songs came pulsing from a kindred throat
as passionate impetuous and free
as sudden shrill with visionary glee
and hoarse with human agonies which smote
thy gentlest heart till it would fain devote
its music unto man's captivity
singing the day when wrath and pride and fear
with the spectral troop of their unholy kind
shall melt in love as shadows disappear
before the sun to evil unresigned
urging the nobler discontent i hear
in all these restless voices of the wind
the summer comes again by vale and hill
with blossoms fashioning her fragrant way
but thou the child of summer to the day
art long unknown and all thy steps are still
in summer thou wert born and didst fulfill
thy scanty urn of years while summer spray
whitened the shores where thy mute image lay
robbed of its poet hence the summers will
seek thee in vain the eye that watched the cloud
hath locked its sight beneath the fallen lid
the ear that heard the skylark's note is vowed
to a perpetual quiet thou art hid
beyond the summers and thy name belongs
but to a ceaseless melody of songs
we labor and are heavy laden where
shall we find rest unto our souls we bleed
on thorn and flint and rove in pilgrim weed
from shrine to shrine but comfort is not there
what went we out into thy desert bare
o human life to see thy greenest reed
is love unmighty for our utmost need
and shaken with the wind of our despair
a voice from heaven like dew on hermon falleth
that voice whose passion paled the olive leaf
in thy dusk aisles gethsemane thou blest
of gardens 'tis the man of sorrows calleth
the man of sorrows and acquaint with grief
come unto me and i will give you rest
we count them happy who have richly known
the sweets of life the sunshine on the hills
the mosses in the valley love that fills
the heart with tears as fragrant as thine own
o tender moonlight lily over blown
when the inevitable season wills
by gentle winds beside thy native rills
we count them happy yet not these alone
there is a crown of thorns way of the cross
consuming fire that burns the spirit pure
by luster of the gold set free from dross
by light of heaven seen best through earth's obscure
by the exceeding gain that waits on loss
behold we count them happy who endure
thou knowest thou who art the soul of all
selfless endeavor how i longed to make
this deed of mine adventured for love's sake
thy deed  sweet grapes upon a sunny wall
a rose whose petals into fragrance fall
a glint of heaven glassed in some lonely lake
amidst the heather and the fringing brake
our secret  ah thou knowest
only for pardon still to thee i bring
my poor shamed deed that craved the beautiful
to thee the master artist who alone
wilt of thy grace see in this graceless thing
the pattern marred by the imperfect tool
and know that dim wronged pattern for thine own
come hither taunted bird and i will stroke
thy ruffled plumage with a verse o triste
and sombre minstrel at our twelfth night feast
a music masquerading in thy croak
how often when the wild march mornings broke
have i descried thee like a demon priest
heaping hoarse curses on the riotous east
from the bare branches of some tossing oak
yet ever welcome is thy wizard flight
most welcome now when earth lies imaging
the sleep of death beneath a winding sheet
of frozen snow intolerably white
a pallid waste crossed by the sudden fleet
beautiful shadow of thy sable wing
a naked tree against the sunset sky
a tall black tree whose leaves of emerald sheen
that blissful birds were wont to peep between
long since have fallen through her summit high
the winter winds have swept with bitter cry
and left her desolate a crownless queen
yet beautiful for amber lights serene
that all the ebon outlines glorify
the light the light 'mid her abandoned bare
stript branches like a tracery of jet
streams heavenly splendor fairer to behold
than all those summer graces they forget
her boughs are as a shadow on the air
a foil a fretwork in the flood of gold
arise come forth into the night arise
belovéd for her dusky lips will teach
a nobler tale than any mortal speech
and the pure lights of her eternal eyes
beyond all anger sorrow and surprise
look with the same large loveliness on each
not human fashion scorning who beseech
to cherish those who scorn the gleaming skies
are royal with old goddesses and queens
whose faces lit the earth till banished thence
they watch from heaven the fair familiar scenes
that nevermore shall do them reverence
though humbled cassiopaea earthward leans
and cynthia sheds her old beneficence
when it befortunes us who love so dearly
to hurt each other let us haste to wring
this joy from our remorseful passioning
the wound is witness that we love sincerely
so slight a weapon word or silence merely
would scarce effect surprisal of a sting
were't not my word thy silence for we cling
one soul together life allots austerely
unto the rose of love the thorny power
to tear the heart but ah love's anodyne
the prick but proves the presence of the flower
our one white rose from gardens all divine
then only then could grief outlast her hour
were i ungrieved by least rebuff of thine
the shadow of death's wing had fallen grey
upon her face the mother face our star
of home since life first read its calendar
within our smiles we felt her slip away
our vain hold clinging to an empty clay
down that hushed valley where the white mists are
on to its utmost verge so far so far
that her return was but as spirits may
briefly revisit earth for oh she shone
transfigured yet so winsome that our awe
was blended with her own beatitude
the burden of her fourscore years was gone
escaped from time she mocked his mighty law
her children looked upon her maidenhood
eager and shy as when among her peers
a girl will pour her confidence she told
in voice where laughter ran a thread of gold
a history all novel to our ears
her blissful eyes oblivious of tears
with lingering touch she one by one unrolled
her bridal memories from fold on fold
of fragrant silence dead thse fifty years
was he with whom young hand in hand she went
to their first home which simple neighbor folk
had filled with garden bloom and forest scent
yet still of him and that june path they fared
those welcoming flowers her failing accents spoke
of how love led her to a place prepared
when the bruised heart bewildered first and numb
quickened to pain how passing strange it seemed
to miss her comfort she who still esteemed
old lore above the schools would she not come
with potency of hoarded balsamum
to heal the hurt thus craving her i dreamed
before me sundering east from west there gleamed
a marble wall illimitable dumb
a blank of white when lo her own sweet face
with no more halo than the crispy lace
i knew so well from sudden casement smiled
her blithe audacious self infringing so
with stolen peep death's new punctiliom
breaking his code to reassure her child
our wellesley knew thee but a few swift years
a maiden spirit fresh as morning skies
pale beauty of the face and frank young eyes
with privacies of tenderness and tears
half shy half proud amid thy clustering peers
thou borest thee in queenly lily wise
yet swaying toward them in a sweet surprise
of love and faith  prophetic atmospheres
for summer shone and goldenly thine heart
bloomed into bliss but now  oh strange new ache
that makes itself familiar  now thou art
a broken lily all untimely dimmed
a broken lily for whose vanished sake
our speech is faint our eyes are overbrimmed
there is a life outwearing even grief
our shining lily of the sunbeams fain
smit by a sudden vehemence of rain
is dashed to earth with ruined cup and leaf
but death her troubler holds his mortal fief
of love the overlord whose meads retain
a perfume sweeter for the bruise and stain
abiding fragrance of a blossom brief
transplanted be it so to gardens bright
where drooping lilies sprent with honey dew
by angel touches wax more dazzling white
than eye conceives beneath this baffling blue
at least remains to us of shadowed sight
thy folding effluence of fair and true
god pity all whose hearts are anguish torn
for loss of her but softest mercies flow
on these her little ones who cannot know
what cause their baby voices have to mourn
in vain their fitful cries pursue her borne
from rooms belovéd yet content to go
sealed in that ivory trance from joy and woe
her bridal raiment now serenely worn
too young for memory too young to miss
her cherishments and yet it may not be
as they had never felt the mother kiss
nor reached their wandering hands to catch her smile
but haply dreamland keeps some charméd isle
where love shall brood them safe from storm and sea
only a year but how art thou exalted
in that remoteness of unanswering death
not words could utter what thy silence saith
for oft in fellowship thy words we faulted
pointing how here and there the logic halted
but now that god hath hushed the laboring breath
thy silence all thy words interpreteth
serene majestic silence o'er us vaulted
as the blue arch of sky only a year
and thou who wast familiar art become
a name of awe what ranked as commonplace
mere daily running of the daily race
is waxen to heroic life is dumb
and waits on death to make her meanings clear
white lies the winter on the weary land
winter of many a loss and many a grief
yet must this burial day be counted chief
of sorrows and most sore to understand
for god hath laid the lightning of his hand
on his own signal tower for all too brief
a date outsoaring mists of unbelief
to drink the living blue a beacon grand
but whilst the desolate throng without the portal
of solemn trinity in silence waits
as listening for the beat of passing wing
to view that clay which harbored an immortal
down the bleak air a tender breath of spring
steals like a waft from heaven's glad opening gates
within the beauteous walls again too strait
for the wistful flocks who mourn their shepherd gone
since here all creeds one shining garment don
one seamless robe  our heavy spirits wait
on the old hebraic anthem passionate
and fall of hallowed words that bear upon
their cadences strange consolation won
from centuries of faith reverberate
but oh the empty pulpit eloquent
of death the sable pulpit over all
yet even here is soul with flesh at strife
for wise and tender was the hand that lent
a glowing wreath to that funereal pall
against the gloom the exultant flush of life
for all the saints who from their labors rest
white gleam the lilies on the lifted bier
as reverently the youthful bearers rear
their sad belovéd burden pacing west
whilst all that host as from a single breast
one voice of praise outringing sweet and clear
peals the triumphal chant he loved to hear
thy name o jesu be forever blest
ah turn and watch the pageantry of woe
out through the darkened door the glory hymn
wavers a space but swells again for lo
the dismal pomp of death the mourners slow
the shrouded casket on the vision dim
that gleam of easter lilies dazzles so
the train wends outward where new thousands wait
beneath an ampler temple arch of sky
to speed with murmurous prayer and paean high
the royal progress of that sombre state
on through the streets to sorrow consecrate
on where thy sons hushed harvard gather nigh
to glean a blessing from the passing by
and so to auburn's unrestoring gate
is this thy victory death not thine not thine
howe'er to grief we grant her natural throes
he prophesied of lifewe asked a sign
so little mortals know for what they pray
and by his open grave amid the snows
a chastened city keeps her easter day
from dim aerial depths a silver light
stole forth and formed and soared against the sky
a domelike summit gloriously bright
the adoration of the gazing eye
mont blanc o beautiful beyond all dream
that thou for our great longing shouldst put by
thy curtains woven soft with mist and gleam
in such a splendor queen of air are those
lustres miraculously white supreme
in sparkling radiance on the blue repose
of heaven thy diamond crusted veils thy frore
virginal vesture of eternal snows
we have beheld the vision evermore
must our poor life be nobler than before
here will i build a temple i the lord
ramses the great crowned with the double crown
son of the sun whose chariot wheels swept down
the hosts of kadesh and whose thirsty sword
hath revelled in this ethiopian horde
smiting their necks to teach them my renown
pyloned and obelisked in many a town
i build a shrine wherein to be adored
take me this mountain of the living rock
hew it and hollow carve its river face
as mountain never yet was carved to bear
my likenesses repeated like a prayer
then probe it to its inmost secret place
and sculpture godhood from the savage block
the temple cliff against the soft deep blue
of nubia's star sown sky stands ashen grey
save where like sifted snow or frosted spray
the moonlight blanches it supreme in view
sit throned the four colossi emblems true
of thine illimitable pride thou clay
dust of the desert ramses strewn to day
in shattered images thine egypt through
yet the stupendous four are meek to him
graved at the hewn rock's heart eternal dim
a god with gods with that dread trinity
burning harmachis and the death white ptah
and lord of thrones the high plumed ammon ra
the pharaoh mates his mock divinity
the dawn light steals across the solemn nile
warms the huge knees and stony silent lips
of those ranged giants through the portal slips
and up the great osiris columns while
chamber on chamber brightens aisle on aisle
the walls wax wonderful with mystic ships
and pageantry of war blue lotus dips
in sacrifice and sudden faces smile
yet poignant penetrant the level beam
strikes down those dusky courts to that last gloom
of zenith splendor and the sun in tomb
of night with ramses their beloved one
and fires their altar with a fleeting gleam
the treasure of the valley red and tall
they rise those sandstone fragments overgrown
with fern and ivy and sweet blossom sown
by pitying winds from broken arch and wall
the harebell glistens nightshade thickets pall
bruised effigy and sunken altar stone
what man rejected nature makes her own
her comfort creeps where cross and pillar fall
still sacred though in lieu of white procession
of chanting monks the mossy shafts look down
on children's blithe voiced play though robins nest
in sculptured angel wing and carven crown
perchance more sacred for the heart's confession
lies bare to him the heart's eternal quest
these are the hills our poet langland trod
weary forwandered from the sunrise flush
to amber evening thrilled by merle and thrush
long will whose sombre soul went pilgrim shod
seeking saint truth men called him churl and clod
he heard them not rapt in his dream's deep hush
hardly he heard the merry waters gush
still wandering with no company but god
these hills are holy ground because of thee
o earthborn who wouldst make no peace with earth
craving that visionary clime where all
thy troubled field of folk at last shall be
one brotherhood in labor and in mirth
and not a blessing undivided fall
they chime they chime the sweet cathedral bells
cleaving my cloudy thought if murkiest cloud
e'er hung so heavy as on spirit bowed
this drear confusion weighs where is it dwells
my truth of soul what veil of shifting spells
duties unduteous glamours disallowed
myself doth from myself forever shroud
once more that silver throated peal outwells
amid the chanting throng i kneel alone
mute dull of heart yet fain to screen the brow
interpret me to heaven deep organ tone
clamor of rooks from pinnacle and spire
hails an encrimsoned east but chill and gray
below the pillared vistas arch away
through shadowy nave to glory smitten choir
where orient sunbeams thrill with jeweled fire
the dreaming glass that blossoms unto day
in roseate plumes and golden halo ray
and seraph faces rapt with god desire
ah yet these walls though hoary with the woe
and shrift of centuries are all too strait
for such a splendor from the elm roofed lawn
where thostles chant and streams responsive flow
i'll worship him on whom my longings wait
before the great east window of the dawn
seems there a hand outstretched to bar the way
a voice that says this door to you is closed
are all your plans mysteriously opposed
your course of progress hampered by delay
seems chance to you but mischance with no ray
of clear good fortune through the clouds disclosed
though some appear to thrive who idly dozed
while you were up and doing with the day
so seems it to us all though long delayed
your time will come so labor and be wise
so came the indian's who had sought the aid
of a small shrub—it failed him—in surprise
he frowned—but there in glittering veins displayed
potosi's mine of silver met his eyes
ere greece soared showering sovranties of light
ere rome shook earth with her tremendous tread
ere yon blue feasting sun god burst blood red
beneath thee slept thy prodigy o night
aeons have ta'en like dreams their strange slow flight
and vastest tiniest creatures paved her bed
e'en cities sapped by the usurping spread
of her imperious waves have sunk from sight
since she first chanted her colossal psalms
that swell and sink beneath the listening stars
oft as with myriad drums beating to arms
she thunders out the grandeur of her wars
then shifts through moaning moods her wizard charms
of slow flutes and caressing gay guitars
with eastern banners flaunting in the breeze
royal processions sounding fife and gong
and showering jewels on the jostling throng
march to the tramp of marlowe's harmonies
he drained life's brimming goblet to the lees
he recked not that a peer superb and strong
would tune great notes to his impassioned song
and top his cannonading lines with ease
to the wild clash of cymbals we behold
the tragic ending of his youthful life
the revelry of kisses bought with gold
the jest and jealous rival and the strife
a harlot weeping o'er a corpse scarce cold
a scullion fleeing with a bloody knife
some lip will use her name  a rapt surprise
passing the heart's set ward upon me steals
one word to me doth one saint canonize
and all the acquest of earth and heaven it seals
i name that name and doubt for me has ending
and sorrow strong of old forgets her part
the battle cry it is to god ascending
for all the triumphs of my labouring heart
ah what is beauty's charge what true what dearest
but that one lovely word will speak it home
to splendour to humility 'tis nearest
and the last depths of longing it can plumb
the plaudit of all joy all good it bears
i breathe it and a breath completes my prayers
no 'twas the questing dream that first achieved her
more sensed for knowing no material part
more real that no false outward eye perceived her
too gross but that pure eye within my heart
nor feigned i as my spirit so embraced her
these arms encumbered might ah could they too
would she not fade as vision e'er effaced her
as loves in this weak flesh so often do
in flesh she might escape me might expire
in the vicissitudes through flesh that range
but being the shadow of my heart's desire
she could not pass beyond me could not change
o paradox want food  you are richer fed
lack the coarse crumbs  you find diviner bread
the storm is done  the lightning with its lust
to rend the unhallowed dome in ruin dire
the purple heaps from the rank chaos thrust
on sheets of fell and inauspicious fire
the thunder bellowing loud on every bound
the hissing bolt so tossed as to complete
all permutations of satanic sound
the flood that opened heaven and ransomed it
benign now is that beatific blue
the flame that fires the hill is now remote
from aught in evil clemency anew
crowns every leaf and sings in every throat
shall then the rage of earth and heaven depart
and not the rancour of the unsensing heart
thou grim physician armed with septic shears
thou that dissemblest even in death's repose
earth's quiet pulse and her remedial throes
how dull thy visage on this day appears
let now the dismal heaven give vent its tears
come frozen ever no gale coeval blows
filled with the ravaged perfume of the rose
and keep not all fair things forsaken biers
o haste then spiritless minister thy pains
to charge the sources of the unfruitful earth
for harvests blest in wood in plot and lawn
o laggard on till fire re flood the veins
of spring here ay to trip the vales with mirth
as long night over does the exulting dawn
rich hour is not thy gift a radiant thing
the truth here blazoned in this marble and gold
here writ in this refulgence manifold
hath sunned my groped redemption lo i fling
how lightly  off ungraced desire i cling
to that faith firm this splendour hath retold
my spirit towered doth its sheer track behold
and shakes the dust of chaos from its wing
life that is death riches named with a lie
this fane would that the sum of both employs
your tears unseal if ignorance could weep
is not true being locked in tombs and die
must not we in death ere life's innater joys
we may as i now clasp as in a sleep
this world is driven by two contending powers
love that coerceth heaven to dwell with dust
and that dire pledge of hell's self perjured lust
and as we list must heaven and hell be ours
not light the election runs lo each devours
that savour set in each while equal gust
each uses yet our choice support we must
blest wine or this rejected sweat that sours
love oft through hell that seems acclaims what heaven
but lust through seeming heaven with easy breath
slides on to hell how soon how richly given
if love to heavenly state so quickeneth
while lust must e'er in cheating hell be shriven
they sponsor what these powers but life and death
sure 'tis the voice of choired saints that flows
along the billows of the softened breeze
and now in falls and dying symphonies
so sweet it glides that forth my rapt soul goes
to join those hymnings ta'en from all her woes
yet once more and once more ye minstrelsies
of power my stormy spirit to appease
with some dissolving dream my thoughts compose
again your strains float sinking on the wind
soft wild and mournful all now melt away
faintly perceived like some expiring ray
of memory that trembles o'er the mind
lovely in its departure still enshrined
as the blest relic of a happy day
where softly steal fantastic shadows grim
o'er bannered wall limned saint prone effigies
and time etched brass sleeps dust choked mute as these
the voice that stirred the minster's arches dim
with master touch obedient fingers skim
in eager joyance o'er the yielding keys
and the groined vault is filled with harmonies
that soar and swell in grand triumphant hymn
thus some great soul cloistered amid the gloom
and shades of prisoning shell in silence waits
the word inbreathed that shall to the dumb clod
give speech as wingèd spirit from its tomb
his message flies—nathless the erst barred gates—
and hushed men whisper hark the voice of god
go read the patent of thine heritage
inscribed in glowing words that flash and burn
with pregnant import con it well and learn
the thrilling tale that lights the storied page
see faith and valor hand to hand engage
opposing powers and by their prowess turn
the wild into a puissant realm and earn
a deathless fame bright to the latest age
'tis thine and mine shall we then hold it light—
despise our birthright as some base born churl
and recreant yield it with a nerveless hand
or stainour scutcheon with a judasblight
when traitors hiss do thou indignant hurl
thy challenge back it ismy
a nymph is dead mild virtuous young and fair
death never counts by days or months or years
oft in his sight the infant old appears
and to his earthly mansion must repair
why should our sighs disturb the quiet air
for when the flood of time to ruin bears
no beauty can prevail nor parents' tears
when life is gone we of the flesh despair
yet still the happy soul immortal lives
in heaven as we with pious hope conceive
and to the maker endless praises gives
that she so soon this loathsome world might leave
we judge that glorious spirit doubly blest
which from short life ascends t'eternal rest
straight remnant of the spiry birchen bough
that over the streamlet wont perchance to quake
thy many twinkling leaves and bending low
beheld thy white rind dancing on the lake
how doth thy present state poor stick awake
my pathos  for alas even stripped as thou
may be my beating breast if ever forsake
philisto this poor heart and break his vow
so musing on i fare with many a sigh
and meditating then on times long past
to thee lorn pole i look with tearful eye
as all beside the floor soiled pail thou art cast
and my sad thoughts while i behold thee twirled
turn on the twistings of this troublous world
so thou art come again old black winged night
like an huge bird between us and the sun
hiding with out stretched form the genial light
and still beneath thine icy bosom's dun
and cloudy plumage hatching fog breathed blight
and embryo storms and crabbeacuted frosts that shun
day's warm caress the owls from ivied loop
are shrieking homage as thou towerest high
like sable crow pausing in eager stoop
on the dim world thou gluttest thy clouded eye
silently waiting latest time's fell whoop
when thou shalt quit thine eyrie in the sky
to pounce upon the world with eager claw
and tomb time death and substance in thy maw
it is a lovely stream its wavelets purl
as if they echoed to the fall and rise
of the capricious breeze each upward curl
that splashes pearl mirrors the fairy eyes
of viewless passer and the billows hurl
their sparkles on her lap as over she flies
and see where onward whirls within a ring
of smoothest dimples a dark foxglove bell
half stifled by the gush encircling
perchance some tiny sprite crawled to that shell
to sleep away the noon and winds did swing
him into rest for the warm sun was well
shaded off by the long and silky down
so i will save it lest the elf should drown
snowdrop of dogs with ear of brownest dye
like the last orphan leaf of naked tree
which shudders in bleak autumn though by thee
of hearing careless and untutored eye
not understood articulate speech of men
nor marked the artificial mind of books
the mortal's voice eternized by the pen
yet hast thou thought and language all unknown
to babel's scholars oft intensest looks
long scrutiny over some dark veined stone
dost thou bestow learning dead mysteries
of the world's birthday oft in eager tone
with quick tailed fellows bandiest prompt replies
solicitudes canine four footed amities
what honey in the year's last flowers can hide
these little butterflies may know
with falling leaves they waver to and fro
or on the swinging tops of asters ride
but i am weary of the summer's pride
and sick september's simulated show
why do the colder winds delay to blow
and bring the pleasant hours that we abide
to curtained alcove and sweet household talks
or sweeter silence by our flickering lars
returning late from autumn evening walks
upon the frosty hills while reddening mars
hangs low between the withered mullein stalks
and upward throngs the host of winter stars
the little creek which yesterday i saw
ooze through the sedges and each brackish vein
that sluiced the marsh now filled and then again
sucked dry to glut the sea's unsated maw
all ebb and flow by the same rhythmic law
that times the beat of the atlantic main
they also fastened to the swift moon's train
by unseen cords that no less strongly draw
so poet may thy life's small tributary
threading some bitter marsh obscure alone
feel yet one pulse with the broad estuary
that bears an emperor's fleets through half a zone
may wait upon the same high luminary
and pitch its voice to the same ocean's tone
he sang one song and died    no more but that
a single song and carelessly complete
he would not bind and thresh his chance grown wheat
nor bring his wild fruit to the common vat
to store the acid rinsings thin and flat
squeezed from the press or trodden under feet
a few slow beads blood red and honey sweet
oozed from the grape which burst and spilled its fat
but time who soonest drops the heaviest things
that weight his pack will carry diamonds long
so through the poets' orchestra which weaves
one music from a thousand stops and strings
pierces the note of that immortal song
high over all the lonely bugle grieves
the leaves which in the autumn of the year
fall auburn tinted leaving reft and bare
their parent trees in many a sheltered lair
where winter waits and watches cold austere
will lie in drifts and when the snowdrops cheer
the woodland shadows still the leaves are there
though through the glades the balmy southern air
and birds and boughs proclaim that spring is here
so lost hopes severed by the stress of life
lie all unburied yet before our eyes
though none but we regard their mute decay
and ever amid this stir and moil and strife
fresh aims and growing purposes arise
above the faded hopes of yesterday
time speeding rules all things compelled obey
oh may this king ne'er turn your love from me
may every year's forced march a blessing be
your love recruiting driving fears away
dear guide nought can thy tender care repay
each seeming harsh reproof
an act of love received—ungratefully
recalling conscience forces me to say
feel not amid the greetings of this morn
a blank because from sight my
though i be absent yet my heart's at home
hailing thy
each absence makes me prize my home the
return shall find me—worthier than before
loud from its wicker cage the thrush yet sings
the blackbird pipes though now it may no more
flit through the orchard as it did before
in spite of bars the lark its carollings
still pours and stretches still its useless wings
as when it could at will to heaven soar
in sooth though it should be a dungeon floor
the place is nought if god has touched the strings
the music of his soul in melodies
e'en there the wretched captive will outpour
will even there to dull insensate things
attune his harp as orpheus oft of yore
so poets tell in his sad wanderings
played to the rocks and hills and brooks and trees
deck thee with jewels from the indian mine
and fetch thy robes from silken samarcand
such never shall thy beauteous eyes outshine
nor these outshame the lily of thy hand
take to thee gold it shall not that outvie
poured by thy locks in such a flowing stream
lay to thy bosom pearls and could these sigh
then would they sigh that they might fairer seem
but oh ten thousand others can do this
and charm for charm display as well as thou
can smile as sweet and as divinely kiss
and show as fair a hand as smooth a brow
ten thousand others can do this but none
can move this heart to love as thou hast done
in freedom's cause it were a joy to die
the stake the dungeon and the gory block
these are the deep foundations of that rock
whence rise the sacred walls of liberty
each groan each tear each whitened hair each sigh
each rusted chain each bolt each bar each lock
what are they but the powers at last which mock
the baffled rage of dying tyranny
thus when all's done which mortal man can do
the last word spoken tyrants dread to hear
the last bow struck it were indeed a shame
if we at freedom's call should fail to bear
with dignity that lot she grants but few
to die and dying bless her sacred name
as when a son by his dead father kneels
and cries forgive me father i repent
those pallid lips make no acknowledgment
nor any smile across those features steals
yea though he grasps his hand the dead nor feels
nor moves nor knows the form above him bent
but now past all approval or dissent
turns a deaf ear to all that son's appeals
so too with us when tearfully we stand
beside dead memories of the days which were
could we but grasp again that loving hand
could we but speak again to him or her
in vain as well expect at our command
the silent dead to smile again or stir
be nothing altered of all god hath done
for who can work divinely fair as he
who knows what is and more what is to be
and what to use and what to let alone
nor doth he need to move again that stone
once laid nor doth he lack the power as we
to add to all its matchless symmetry
from ophir gold and beams from lebanon
so to build up the white dome of the soul
a stately palace an eternal home
for god himself at length made pure and fit
where with great power the lord himself will come
and with assembled angels crown the whole
with songs and shoutings of grace grace to it
i see thee go about thy household ways
and nothing count too irksome or too mean
which being done had earned another's praise
or being left some other's grief had been
or being spoken had laid balm between
the breath of slander and the wounded part
or being thought had caused the judgment lean
less to the brain and more unto the heart
and so from room to room i see thee move
and all the house to fill with quietness
that all who see thee must perforce thee love
that all who hear thee must perforce thee bless
like some bright angel doomed to penance here
for some slight fault so dost thou love appear
o be thou 'ware since thus on thee i look
thou lead me not in any wise astray
seek thou heaven's grace and lady see thou brook
no sin upon thy soul by night or day
i toil on after up the shining way
i would ascend be thou my spirit's guide
there is no joy like theirs who thus assay
nor shall be crown that brighter shines beside
i charge thee then by all of good and fair
that thou pursue unmoved thy upward road
to fairer scenes to realms of purer air
to nobler heights to heaven and to god
i follow on now near and now afar
but yet i follow on o my life's star
love health but let it be the love of youth
love peace but let it be before the fray
love mercy but before you go astray
and you yourself have need of pitying ruth
love wisdom's ways but love them most in sooth
ere folly turns your locks to sober gray
love purity since love her well you may
but most of all love early golden truth
she is of such divinity that where
she leads all other graces still attend
as do the roses the sweet month of june
but she away those graces have an end
and perish as the flowers of summer soon
as autumn with his breath makes all things bare
be nothing altered of all god hath done
i would not now have back these weary years
to spend them other than i have thou tears
alone could win them what god hath begun
i pray to him to finish when we shun
those ills our sin sick heart for ever fears
and choose the good or that which good appears
were god as we how soon our course were run
who knows life's chart entire knows best to steer
our erring craft across its fitful sea
little our progress while the skies are clear
but when god's storm breaks forth tumultuously
each fearful gust brings us to land more near
and to that haven where our souls would be
he stood behind the counter mixing drinks
pride for the old who like their liquor tart
green scorn frappeacute to cheer the sick at heart
false joy as merry as a bed of pinks
he had the eyes of a sarcastic lynx
and in his apron was a small black dart
with which he stirred secretive and apart
his shaker till it rang with poisonous clinks
i fumbled for the rail the same with gin
love    triple star    you like the velvet kick
i shook with the blind agues of the sick
then through lost worlds his voice fini old friend
he poured black drops out cold as dead men's skin
so this is what we always recommend
o have you seen the scarlet pimpernel
the wild sea flavored blossom of the strand
the token flower the pledge of sea and land
and have you learned to heed its secret spell
aurora's friend it loves the morning well
and you shall find it open to your hand
the sunny morning through—but understand
storm clouds will close it closer than a shell
love is the pimpernel then do not wait
go in the morning faithful to the hour
go when thy lady keeps her matin state
her heart is coy and closes like a flower
go in the sunlight haste and claim love's boon
nor tempt the changing skies and afternoon
time thou destroyest the relics of the past
and hidest all the footprints of thy march
on shattered column and on crumbled arch
by moss and ivy growing green and fast
hurled into fragments by the tempest blast
the rhodian monster lies the obelisk
that with sharp line divided the broad disk
of egypt's sun down to the sands was cast
and where these stood no remnant trophy stands
and even the art is dead by which they rose
thus with the monuments of other lands
the place that knew them now no longer knows
yet triumph not o time strong towers decay
but a great name shall never pass away
what though my years are falling like thy leaves
oh autumn  when the winds are plumed with night
they have thy colors thy enameled light
and all the fullness of thy ripened sheaves
of verdant joys aggressive time bereaves
and the glad transports of unclouded dawn
but though the shadows deepen on life's lawn
rays of serene and solemn beauty shed
a mellow lustre on my fading hours
and with a calm and tempered joy i tread
paths still bedecked with iridescent flowers
like thine oh autumn ere the sober gray
of winter steals thy glorious tints away
upon an eminence i seem to stand
and look around me backward i survey
a lovely prospect stretching far away
through mists that curtain all the nearer land
there once i wandered gayly hand in hand
with the companions of my happy spring
it was life's realm of fairy rainbow spanned
where birds and brooks together loved to sing
and every cloud made pictures as it sailed
that music yet resounds those pictures shine
through the far distance time has faintly veiled
though many a rock stream valley intervene
between me and that fairy haunted scene
heart that with warm and generous feeling beat
how strange it seems to one who loved thee well
that over thee has pealed the solemn knell
and not one spark of all that genial heat
remains each high born sympathy to greet
and glow with fond affection when some word
uttered in tone harmonious low and sweet
thy fervent depths to kind emotions stirred
alas  that thou when life was doubly dear
when once more reunited to thine own
after such weary years of absence flown
should'st be translated  though to that bright sphere
on which in child like earnestness and faith
thy looks were turned beyond the door of death
is this a painting are those pictured clouds
which on the sky so movelessly repose
has some rare artist fashioned forth the shrouds
of yonder vessel are these imaged shows
of outline figure form or is there life—
life with a thousand pulses— in the scene
we gaze upon those towering banks between
e'er tossed these billows in tumultuous strife
billows there's not a wave the waters spread
one broad unbroken mirror all around
is hushed to silence— silence so profound
that a bird's carol or an arrow sped
into the distance would like larum bell
jar the deep stillness and dissolve the
he came in silvern armour trimmed with black
a lover come from legends long ago
with silver spurs and silken plumes a blow
and flashing sword caught fast and buckled back
in a carven sheath of tamarack
he came with footsteps beautifully slow
and spoke in voice meticulously low
he came and romance followed in his track
i did not ask his name  i thought him love
i did not care to see his hidden face
all life seemed born in my intaken breath
all thought seemed flown like some forgotten dove
he bent to kiss and raised his visor's lace
all eager lipped i kissed the mouth of death
some things are very dear to me
such things as flowers bathed by rain
or patterns traced upon the sea
or crocuses where snow has lain
the iridescence of a gem
the moon's cool opalescent light
azaleas and the scent of them
and honeysuckles in the night
and many sounds are also dear
like winds that sing among the trees
or crickets calling from the weir
or negroes humming melodies
but dearer far than all surmise
are sudden tear drops in your eyes
in the white sweetness of her dimpled chin
the pink points of her perfumed fingers press
and 'round her tremulous mouth's loveliness
the tears and smiles a sudden strife begin
first one and then the other seems to win
and o'er her drooping eyes a golden tress
falls down to hide what else they might confess
their blue veined lids are striving to shut in
the yellow pearls that bind her throat about
with her pale bosom's throbbing rise or fall
the while her thoughts like carrier doves have fled
to that far land where armies clash and shout
and where beyond love's reach a soldier tall
with staring eyes and broken sword lies dead
sea like in billowy distance far away
the half broke prairies stretch on every hand
how wide the circuit of their summer day
what measureless acres of primeval land
treeless and birdless by no eyesight spanned
looking along the horizon's endless line
man seems a pigmy in these realms of space
no segment of our planet  so divine
turns up such beauty to the moon's fair face
here are soft grasses flowers of tender hue
palimpsests of the old and coming race
vistas most wonderful and vast and new
and see  above  where giant lightnings play
from what an arch the sun pours forth the day
look how the pale queen of the silent night
doth cause the ocean to attend upon her
and he as long as she is in his sight
with her full tide is ready her to honor
but when the silver waggon of the moon
is mounted up so high he cannot follow
the sea calls home his crystal waves to moan
and with low ebb doth manifest his sorrow
so you that are the sovereign of my heart
have all my joys attending on your will
my joys low ebbing when you do depart
when you return their tide my heart doth fill
so as you come and as you do depart
joys ebb and flow within my tender heart
music when through my heart in youth's bright morn
your flow began to surge emotions known
to that glad time found overflow in tone
you were confessional then overborn
in tumultuous tests with rushing wind and storm
the shell of life was hither thither blown
though only echoes lingered  old forms had flown
still melody my searching hours transform
i need not seek beyond the night bird's song
soaring in melody above the tree
and now a human voice in ethereal praise
answers from deep to deep until we long
to merge our own in reneed minstrelsy
and free all aching hearts for singing days
an old poem returns in this our time
singing as sweetly as in days gone by
tuned to rhythm that can never die
and yet my heart is quiet for i pine
for a lost presence that leaves no sign
a shadowy self that once would smile and sigh
and muse in memory old verse to try
that one might trace the form behind the line
oh heart leap up again just once impart
the fire that animated what was read
again possess the line the poet's dream
and in a flash reveal the magic art
that creates truth leave now no word unsaid
to kindle in the hearts of men the gleam
and still you scorn the confines life would cast
about your fixed and marked identity
a father lover friend tried endlessly
and all the cycled censors failed at last
now resurrected in your revived past
at signal of the butterfly and bee
witness your love wedded in mystery
beyond the book the dream once believed you clasp
not what we read or see or trace in line
becomes the ultimate of greater worth
it is the dream we hold as our own right
unseen by men but envied for the sign
it shines upon the face of these on earth
who cling to love and faith beyond the light
more than a measured space the searching heart
has granted to this herald far ahead
we scarce outline his shadowed counterpart
as down the hurrying years his light is shed
a modern man tradition's silhouette
in that supremacy secure he folds
the barrier that will signify our debt
when time acknowledges the gifts he holds
his light outlines memorials in our day
his words speak for the shattered songs of men
lighting the titan with a piercing ray
we are made one with prophecy again
futurity extends a sheltering palm
and safely draws the poet's dream to calm
beyond the dark beyond the lighted mote
we share your depth and pinnacle of dream
we crave the ecstasy of higher note
searching the lanes where late you traced the gleam
in shadowed brightness now you hover near
why trails your pinion in the breaking dawn
you haunt the gray 'twixt joy and mortal fear
yours is the sweetest saddest voice we muse upon
your wistful words in careless fancy wrought
may answer for our heart's perplexity
restore that moment when your spirit thought
hung pendant trusting all eternity
so may a single bird unsought unseen
trace heaven's hope above time's tarnished green
the little plot i claim for my new share
may be stony harsh and rough with rock
a spot that idle men are wont to mock
and curse as never worth a wise man's care
i leave to them the right to choose and dare
i never gauge my labor by the clock
the fall may never bring my grain to shock
yet on my hearth my fire my fruit i share
the rough endurance of an earlier day
survives and shapes the will to fit the need
and though the ancient quarrel can smart and goad
the back bends to the task the furrowed way
man dream that mother earth will bless the load
his hope vaults high to ride the harvest load
soul searching thou hast journeyed far and wide
on dusty pilgrimages charting the day
for those whose fading forms your power would stay
and fix forever where great truths abide
surely in seeking you will never hide
one portrait lest at teh last in time's own way
our measure be still less than what men say
and all we might bequeath in you will bide
for all the raising of the lifeless forms
that imminence of birth and death revealed
for every waking figure  cold now warm
with confirmation and with wonder sealed
the soul acknowledges the breaking light
and walks with former tread out of the night
i heard a great physician gently say
not one man's life raised up for price or fame
but one gift made to lift the curse of pain
one life of effort just to add one ray
of brighter living in our human day
to fix a bit of life where death has lain
to bless one tortured soul where strength might wane
exceeds the wealth a suffering would would pay
for every man who counts his gifts for gain
a hundred stand to help men on their way
no finer truer souls push back the pall
than those who stand to guard the gates of pain
no gold can recompense the part they play
fighting they watch life's curtains rise and fall
there was one among them spoke as a child
confessed he questioned what he ought to know
some answer that true knowledge would bestow
if he were ready  and in spirit mild
he must have grasped the truth for we beguiled
stand by and marvel that so far below
our little minds question and rarely go
along the mounting trail so strange so wild
he pushes past the last guide post to press
a print to mark the taking of the place
defying precedent the truth he would forecast
into a newer realm beyond the stress
of man's vast ignorance of time and space
that other souls might read the law at last
a dead dog speaks so runs the preacher's text
an ancient line of truth a paradox
that might be listed with the line that shocks
and holds our thought and some way almost next
we pause and read no more until the next
head line allures but even then truth mocks
and he who turns to question and unlocks
the truth of dog and speech may use the text
'tis said the christ spoke many a long lost word
as fraught with life as those we often quote
and once when suddenly he sensed the death
of some poor dog the hurrying crowd then heard
these strange words rise from him who stopped to note
the cur his teeth are whiter than pearls he saith
if from the chaos in the picture's frame
there finally emerge a figure fair
it seems a miracle the brush must dare
if the creator seek for modern fame
perhaps only an initiate dare name
these half real beings  puppets that seem to stare
out through the maze and wait for those who care
enough to recognize them without blame
so often seems the picture of our day
a mass of unrelated forms and light
and if there be a few who see it real
who sense the revelation and dare say
there moves a figure to our deepening sight
from that admission truth may make its seal
far have i wandered in the mind's long quest
and many teachers have i called by name
past all the goals that mark youth's end and aim
now spurs again the urge that knows no rest
which is the trail to take is this way best
with soul more cautious and aware the same
vast range reveals new heights to claim
and fewer guides to chart the heart's new test
now be it found that clearly height on height
the mind retain no excess hopeless load
so when wisdom descends to guide the will
all stands revealed as when a burning light
is set by unseen hands beside a road
and so we safely climb and round the hill
a father is our greatest need today
for all our willful careless venturing
but though one move and act for us  sighing
we see him not or understand the way
he marks from dark to light and still men say
all all is night where is the soul we sing
land of the pilgrim's pride better to bring
a mumbled word than no homage to pay
yet fatherlike he stands for us and prays
his judgment and his power may be our strength
he knows our human need our old time fears
and though it seem his cautious arm delays
his eye surveys our land  its breadth its length
o will he guide us through when this storm clears
along the sunny side of the woodland path
the wild rose hedge now dons its new green gown
now blooms the rose far from the gardened town
now wafts the perfume which no other bloom hath
distilled or dreamed might be though winter's wrath
touched all the man made gardens on hill and down
wild roses wreathe again the spring's gay crown
an old time grace renews the smile the laugh
here is a hope to build through cloud and sun
what though the blossom breathe for one brief hour
the mystery lives in the heart that knows
true beauty believing that the spring will come
strewing pale petals and the perfumed flower
that has never changed  oh sweet wild rose
some gifts a moneyed man can buy for gold
for treasures from your singing heart i long
o friend now give to me your rarer song
for on that coral bank grown slowly old
maturing beauty broods and will enfold
the precious residue of dreams no curse or wrong
has marred your gift but strong as love is strong
your cadenced word reveals what life might hold
serenity exceeding what the will might school
courageous evidence of tested worth
a charity facing the world's demands
all this i recognize in this carved jewel
that has evolved from your fair shore of youth
a perfect part of the true whole it stands
as we hear the nocturne rising once more
flowing through unseen hands caressingly
the power of music rifts our apathy
unvoiced longings uncharted hopes  the store
youth yields to age rise in the heart's deep core
song phrasings linger still and certainly
we follow up the strain and memory
recalls the way that love once sang its lore
then the recurring cadence rose supreme
above life's jangled strains and so it grew
to dominate the perfect arc the heart
declared high festival part real part dream
and now there sounds a beat the artist knew
while faint and fainter sounds the singing part
my children are my own interpreters
of this strange modern world of ours
that seems to yield no keys no pass no powers
into my hands unless perchance the spurs
that now and then i loan and there occurs
so grave a doubt such hounding of the hours
i choose to trust the child that never cowers
that i may share his lot whate'er incurs
one sweeps the univers unseen but heart
one loafs along the field the stream the height
one delves into the mind's rich vein of ore
and mother like i pray some magic word
of mine be near if tears should blind their sight
and may my love illumine more and more
perhaps unseeing through mount wilson's eye
we look beside us looms one that can see
speechless we leave the modern laboratory
recalling just a flash of truth we sigh
confounded by the answer to our why
no man can comprehend for certainty
the workings of a soul to set life free
because the soul is high as heaven is high
posterity lives in the einstein mind
it traces out the maze of michelson
it works within the brain of millikan
and if we marvel how its findings bind
our common soul  each age has sought and won
a power unseen that would lift up all men
bard immortal your word is as a ledge
on which men lean and vision life at best
alas that lachesis withheld the pledge
that every verse of worth will now attest
those seeing eyes that see not ever quail
their length or lot of life determines sight
i stand condemned if in my day i fail
to meet your word and there behold the light
were it not fitting then serving life's hours
to bear the best a poet's heart e'er gives
and measure to this heritage of ours
nor miss one cadenced line where shakespeare lives
the april of his prime speaks in this place
through windows of my age his light i trace
i note your shawl bonnet and sturdy shoe
your dress your swinging step your out stretched hand
your forward searching eye across the land
i trace my own ancestry back through you
no longer is your figure strange and new
but animated with the forms that stand
enshrined in memory  the mother band
that followed to the west so fine so true
that soul that spurned the allegheny range
that one adventuring far far beyond
the vermont hills and destined to meet its own
again and yet again to pass so strange
the emerging a child and mother fond
still following the lure of fire and home
today all barriers in your garden lift
an instant and the poet in your breast
swings on the compass of the further west
and you become a dream of wings that drift
on upper reaches where the eye may rift
uncharted places and put earth to test
proven  your words anchor the souls unrest
the flowering magic of the ash i sift
and now i wait reluctant that i leave
this endeared spot where mysteries are wrought
the pool's mirror the star dust on the green
the eerie sense of some one at my sleeve
all the reality the curious sought
is dimmed at sight of one in silver sheen
thy artistry has touched all types of men
and fashioned them again to forms we know
so when the curtain rises 'tis as though
they speak again father serra then
enters mission walls and roses blow as when
he spoke and now i hear the voice of romeo
in gardens where our loves in may still go
so plays thy voice the harp aeolion
old lear hath found a gratitude in thee
and woolsey proves sincerity through you
and if for sight of all the seven ages
i seek a miniature behold i see
its perfect form to every man his due
master of make believe we are your pages
let others plant vast gardens i am content
with tiny little plots  a pansy bed
a row of gardenias some white some red
and to a sunny spot daphne is sent
with tiny corsages of rarest scent
through every season by my garden led
i wake to be surprised turning my head
to meet the splendor midas must have lent
ah gay woodbine against the stony wall
and goldenrod i thought you'd gone to seed
the purple aster sways  its color fills
the patio the orange tree blooms and all
the roses bare an opening bud nor heed
that frost creeps down the pasadena hills
my shut in window framed for me today
the morning light upon a flowering tree
a brooding bird a gay one soaring free
as swiftly flashed the pictures day did pass
and ere the setting sun burnished my glass
a leaf appeared to dance in ecstasy
and suddenly no leaf my eye could see
beyond my seeing eye the wonders pass
now fleeting shadows seem my dreams to woo
a tireless spinner threads a web of lace
the tall pine tree is tipped with newer green
and where aerial wires appear as new
the shore of cloud land i can clearly trace
now stars appear as guides to worlds unseen
a nation brings its proven gifts to you
take home these flowers from ashes and from tears
they are the blossoms of our harrowed years
strong in the strain of native growth yet new
and burgeoning as sturdy plants will do
they have survived a storm of crushing fears
they have withstood the blight of cruel jeers
now in god's cycled time the flowers are due
no wealth or worldly thing could bring more power
a warmer heart beats for humanity
and more unselfishly men act today
in this your time and deep prophetic hour
men bear the stoics smile in irony
america is furrowing a way
beyond the years there is for us somewhere
a haven that will salvage all life's gifts
a sheltered harbor where in dreams one drifts
against that time i chart the souls i dare
to prophesy are those whose gifts we share
today and then so may the truth that rifts
our cloudy sky be as a beam that lifts
in clear relief the features time calls fair
now to my countrymen in heart and time
i offer neither proof nor record here
rather affection's charting of the dream
of high endeavor in its earthly climb
forgive those tracings not altogether clear
enshrine within your hold the talent's gleam
the lord of light has journey'd down the sky
and bath'd his coursers in the foaming wave
the twinkling star of even too hastes to lave
her silver form and vanish from my eye
now dusky twilight flings her sombre shade
o'er the bright beauties of teh silent vale
the aspen trembles not the verdant blade
no longer nodding answers to the gale
come sweet reflection hither pensive maid
direct thy wandering steps and on this stone
worn by no traveller's feet with moss o'ergrown
repose with me in solitude's deep shade
then shall i know the height of human bliss
and taste the joy of other worlds in this
thou fair hair'd angel of the evening
now whilst the sun rests on the mountains light
thy bright torch of love thy radiant crown
put on and smile upon our evening bed
smile on our loves and while thou drawest the
blue curtains of the sky scatter thy silver dew
on every flower that shuts its sweet eyes
in timely sleep let thy west wind sleep on
the lake speak silence with thy glimmering eyes
and wash the dusk with silver soon full soon
dost thou withdraw then the wolf rages wide
and the lion glares thro' the dun forest
the fleeces of our flocks are cover'd with
thy sacred dew protect them with thine influence
pale pilgrim of the heavens that late didst glide
with sunbeam staff the violet vales along
where fountains of fresh dew gushed up in song
to bathe thy golden feet and then subside
last wave that sparkled on time's ebbing tide
how are thy bright limbs laid amid the throng
of vanished days that drooped over earthly wrong
seeing how virtue is to vice allied
and vanished blushingly
night's winding sheet is round thee and the eyes
that found a health or fever in thy ray
and thoughtfully perused on evening skies
thine elegy star lettered  now away
turn their brief thoughts of thee and thus men moralize
a liberal worldling gay philosopher
art thou that liftst thy young and yellow head
over the dim burial of the scarce cold dead
building above thy brother's sepulchre
a home of love that sense might almost err
deeming thy end therein to woo and wed
the flower haired earth for ever yet the red
in yonder west may well such dreams deter
yes thou all hailed to day whose outstretched hand
scatters loose riches on a bankrupt land
even thou art but a leaf from off the tree
of yellowing time a grain of glistening sand
dashed from the waters of that unsailed sea
where thou to night shalt sink and i as soon may be
gaily and greenly let my seasons run
and should the war winds of the world uproot
the sanctities of life and its sweet fruit
cast forth as fuel for the fiery sun
the dews be turned to ice  fair days begun
in peace wear out in pain and sounds that suit
despair and discord keep hope's harp string mute
still let me live as love and life were one
still let me turn on earth a child like gaze
and trust the whispered charities that bring
tidings of human truth with inward praise
watch the weak motion of each common thing
and find it glorious  still let me raise
on wintry wrecks an altar to the spring
a little child she stood that far off day
when love the master painter took the brush
and on the wall of mem'ry dull and grey
traced tender eyes wide brow and changing blush
the gladness and the youth the bending head
all covered over with its curls of gold
the dimpled arms the two hands filled with bread
to feed the little sparrows brown and bold
that flutter to her feet it hangs there still
just as 'twas painted on that far off day
nor faded is the blush upon the cheek
the sweet lips hold their smiling and can thrill
and still the eyes  so tender and so meek
light up the walls of mem'ry dull and grey
quebec the grey old city on the hill
lies with a golden glory on her head
dreaming throughout this hour so fair  so still
of other days and all her mighty dead
the white doves perch upon the cannons grim
the flowers bloom where once did run a tide
of crimson when the moon rose pale and dim
above the battlefield so grim and wide
methinks within her wakes a mighty glow
of pride of tenderness  her stirring past
the strife the valour of the long ago
feels at her heartstrings strong and tall and vast
she lies touched with the sunset's golden grace
a wondrous softness on her grey old face
mother of the unfortunate mystic form
who calm immutable like oldest fate
sittest where through the sombre swinging gate
moans immemorial life's encircling storm
my heart sore stricken by grief's leaden arm
lags like a weary pilgrim knocking late
and sigheth  toward thee staggering with its weight
behold love conquered by thy son the worm
he stung him mid the roses' purple bloom
the rose of roses yea a thing so sweet
haply to stay blind change's flying feet
and stir with pity the unpitying tomb
here take him cold cold heavy and void of breath
nor me refuse o mother almighty death
cleave thou the waves that weltering to and fro
surge multitudinous the eternal powers
of sun moon stars the air the hurrying hours
the winged winds the still dissolving show
of clouds in calm or storm for ever flow
above thee while the abysmal sea devours
the untold dead insatiate where it lowers
o'er glooms unfathomed limitless below
no longer on the golden fretted sands
where many a shallow tide abortive chafes
mayst thou delay life onward sweeping blends
with far off heaven the dauntless one who braves
the perilous flood with calm unswerving hands
the elements sustain cleave thou the waves
o'er this huge town rife with intestine wars
whence as from monstrous sacrificial shrines
pillars of smoke climb heavenward night inclines
black brows majestical with glimmering stars
her dewy silence soothes life's angry jars
and like a mother's wan white face who pines
above her children's turbulent ways so shines
the moon athwart the narrow cloudy bars
now toiling multitudes that hustling crush
each other in the fateful strife for breath
and hounded on by diverse hungers rush
across the prostrate ones that groan beneath
are swathed within the universal hush
as life exchanges semblances with death
thou sign post of the desert obelisk
once fronting in thy monumental pride
egypt's fierce sun that blazing far and wide
sheared her of tree and herb till like a disk
her waste stretched shadowless and fraught with risk
to those who with their beasts of burden hied
across the seas of sand until they spied
thy pillar and their flagging hearts grew brisk
now reared beside our thames so wintry gray
where blocks of ice drift with the drifting stream
thou risest o'er the alien prospect say
yon dull blear rayless orb whose lurid gleam
tinges the snow draped ships and writhing steam
is this the sun which fired thine orient day
oh in this dearth and winter of the soul
when even hope still wont to soar and sing
droopeth a starveling bird whose downy wing
stiffens ere dead through the dank drift it fall
yea ere hope perish utterly i call
on thee fond memory that thou haste and bring
one leaf one blossom from that far off spring
when love's auroral light lay over all
bring but one pansy haply so the thrill
of poignant yearning for those glad dead years
may like the gutsy south breathe o'er the chill
of frozen grief dissolving it in tears
till numb hope stirred by that warm dropping rain
will deem perchance love's springtide come again
thy wings swoop darkening round my soul despair
and on my brain thy shadow seems to brood
and hem me round with stifling solitude
with chasms of vacuous gloom which are thy lair
no light of human joy no song or prayer
breaks ever on this chaos all imbrued
with heart's blood trickling from the multitude
of sweet hopes slain or agonizing there
lo wilt thou yield thyself to grief and roll
vanquished from thy high seat imperial brain
and abdicating turbulent life's control
be dragged a captive bound in sorrow's chain
nay though my heart is breaking with its pain
no pain on earth has power to crush my soul
love cradling night lit by the lucent moon
most pitiful and mother hearted night
blest armistice in life's tumultuous fight
resolving discords to a spheral tune
when tired with heat and strenuous toil of noon
with ceaseless conflict betwixt might and right
with ebb and flow of sorrow and delight
our panting hearts beneath their burdens swoon
to thee o star eyed comforter we creep
earth's ill used step children to thee make moan
as hiding in thy dark skirts' ample sweep
poor debtors whose brief life is not their own
for dunned by death to whom we owe its loan
give us o night the interest paid in sleep
all treasures of the earth and opulent seas
metals and odorous woods and cunning gold
fowls of the air and furry beasts untold
vineyards and harvest fields and fruitful trees
nature gave unto man and last her keys
vouched passage to her secret ways of old
whence knowledge should be wrung nay power to mould
out of the rough his occult destinies
but tired of these he craved a wider scope
then fair as pallas from the brain of jove
from his deep wish there sprang full armed to cope
with all life's ills even very death in love
the only thing man never wearies of
his own creation  visionary hope
the dead abide with us though stark and cold
earth seems to grip them they are with us still
they have forged our chains of being for good or ill
and their invisible hands these hands yet hold
our perishable bodies are the mould
in which their strong imperishable will
mortality's deep yearning to fulfil
hath grown incorporate through dim time untold
vibrations infinite of life in death
as a star's travelling light survives its star
so may we hold our lives that when we are
the fate of those who then will draw this breath
they shall not drag us to their judgment bar
and curse the heritage which we bequeath
thy life o man in this brief moment lies
time's narrow bridge whereon we darkling stand
with an infinitude on either hand
receding luminously from our eyes
lo there thy past's forsaken paradise
subsideth like some visionary strand
while glimmering faint the future's promised land
illusive from the abyss seems fain to rise
this hour alone hope's broken pledges mar
and joy now gleams before now in our rear
like mirage mocking in some waste afar
dissolving into air as we draw near
beyond our steps the path is sunny clear
the shadow lying only where we are
hurrying for ever in their restless flight
the generations of earth's teeming womb
rise into being and lapse into the tomb
like transient bubbles sparkling in the light
they sink in quick succession out of sight
into the thick insuperable gloom
our futile lives in flashing by illume
lightning which mocks the darkness of the night
nay  but consider though we change and die
if men must pass shall man not still remain
as the unnumbered drops of summer rain
whose changing particles unchanged on high
fixed in perpetual motion yet maintain
the mystic bow emblazoned on the sky
oh ye all ye who suffer here below
schooled in the baffling mystery of pain
who on life's anvil bear the fateful strain
wrong as forged iron hammered blow on blow
take counsel with your grief in that you know
that he who suffers suffers not in vain
nay that it shall be for the whole world's gain
and wisdom prove the priceless price of woe
thus in some new found land where no man's feet
have trod a path bold voyagers astray
may fall foredone by torturing thirst and heat
but from the impotent body of defeat
the winners spring who carve a conquering way
measured by milestones of their perished clay
like a great rock which looming o'er the deep
casts his eternal shadow on the strands
and veiled in cloud inexorably stands
while vaulting round his adamantine steep
embattled breakers clamorously leap
sun garlanded and hope uplifted bands
but soon with waters shattered in the sands
slowly recoiling back to ocean creep
so sternly dost thou tower above us fate
for still our eager hearts exultant beat
borne in the hurrying tide of life elate
and dashing break against thy marble feet
but would hope's rainbow aureole round us fleet
without these hurtling shocks of man's estate
would we but love what will not pass away
the sun that on each morning shines as clear
as when it rose first on the world's first year
the fresh green leaves that rustle on the spray
the sun will shine the leaves will be as gay
when graves are full of all our hearts held dear
when not a soul of those who loved us here
not one is left us  creatures of decay
yea love the abiding in the universe
which was before and will be after us
nor yet for ever hanker and vainly cry
for human love  the beings that change or die
die  change  forget to care so is a curse
yet cursed we'll be rather than not care thus
lo haply walking in some clattering street
where throngs of men and women dumbly pass
like shifting pictures seen within a glass
which leave no trace behind  one seems to meet
in roads once trodden by our mutual feet
a face projected from that shadowy mass
of faces quite familiar as it was
which beaming on us stands out clear and sweet
the face of faces we again behold
that lit our life when life was very fair
and leaps our heart toward eyes and mouth and hair
oblivious of the undying love grown cold
or body sheeted in the churchyard mould
we stretch out yearning hands and grasp  the air
from out the front of being undefiled
a life hath been upheaved with struggle and pain
safe in her arms a mother holds again
that dearest miracle  a new born child
to moans of anguish terrible and wild
as shrieks the night wind through an ill shut pane
pure heaven succeeds and after fiery strain
victorious woman smiles serenely mild
yea shall she not rejoice shall not her frame
thrill with a mystic rapture at this birth
the soul now kindled by her vital flame
may it not prove a gift of priceless worth
some saviour of his kind whose starry fame
shall bring a brightness to the darkened earth
it is a solemn evening golden clear
the alpine summits flame with rose lit snow
and headlands purpling on wide seas below
and clouds and woods and arid rocks appear
dissolving in the sun's own atmosphere
and vast circumference of light whose slow
transfiguration  glow and after glow
turns twilight earth to a more luminous sphere
oh heart i ask seeing that the orb of day
has sunk below yet left to sky and sea
his glory's spiritual after shine
i ask if love whose sun hath set for thee
may not touch grief with his memorial ray
and lend to loss itself a joy divine
the twilight heavens are flushed with gathering light
and o'er wet roofs and huddling streets below
hang with a strange apocalyptic glow
on the black fringes of the wintry night
such bursts of glory may have rapt the sight
of him to whom on patmos long ago
the visionary angel came to show
that heavenly city built of chrysolite
and lo three factory hands begrimed with soot
aflame with the red splendour marvelling stand
and gaze with lifted faces awed and mute
starved of earth's beauty by man's grudging hand
o toilers robbed of labour's golden fruit
ye too may feast in nature's fairyland
the boding sky was charactered with cloud
the scripture of the storm  but high in air
where the unfathomed zenith still was bare
a pure expanse of rose flushed violet glowed
and kindling into crimson light o'erflowed
the hurrying wrack with such a blood red glare
that heaven igniting wildly seemed to flare
on the dazed eyes of many an awe struck crowd
and in far lands folk presaged with blanched lips
disastrous wars earthquakes and foundering ships
such whelming floods as never dykes could stem
or some proud empire's ruin and eclipse
lo such a sky they cried as burned o'er them
once lit the sacking of jerusalem
there was intoxication in the air
the wind keen blowing from across the seas
o'er leagues of new ploughed land and heathery leas
smelt of wild gorse whose gold flamed everywhere
and undertone of song pulsed far and near
the soaring larks filled heaven with ecstasies
and like a living clock among the trees
the shouting cuckoo struck the time of year
for now the sun had found the earth once more
and woke the sleeping beauty with a kiss
who thrilled with light of love in every pore
opened her flower blue eyes and looked in his
then all things felt life fluttering at their core
the world shook mystical in lambent bliss
the year's grown songless no glad pipings thrill
the hedge row elms whose wind worn branches shower
their leaves on the sere grass where some late flower
in golden chalice hoards the sunlight still
our summer guests whose raptures used to fill
each apple blossomed garth and honeyed bower
have in adversity's inclement hour
abandoned us to bleak november's chill
but hearken yonder russet bird among
the crimson clusters of the homely thorn
still bubbles o'er with little rills of song
a blending of sweet hope and resignation
even so when life of love and youth is shorn
one friend becomes its last best consolation
all night all day in dizzy downward flight
fell the wild whirling vague chaotic snow
till every landmark of the earth below
trees moorlands roads and each familiar sight
were blotted out by the bewildering white
and winds now shrieking loud now whimpering low
seemed lamentations for the world old woe
that death must swallow life and darkness light
but all at once the rack was blown away
the snowstorm hushing ended in a sigh
then like a flame the crescent moon on high
leaped forth among the planets pure as they
earth vied in whiteness with the milky way
herself a star beneath the starry sky
a stormy light of sunset glows and glares
between two banks of cloud and o'er the brine
thy fair lamp on the sky's carnation line
alone on the lone promontory flares
friend of the fisher who at nightfall fares
where lurk false reefs masked by the hyaline
of dimpling waves within whose smile divine
death lies in wait behind circean snares
the evening knows thee ere the evening star
or sees that flame sole regent of the bight
when storm hoarse rumoured by the hills afar
makes mariners steer landward by thy light
which shows through shock of hostile nature's war
how man keeps watch o'er man through deadliest night
even as on some black background full of night
and hollow storm in cloudy disarray
the forceful brush of some great master may
more brilliantly evoke a higher light
so beautiful so delicately white
so like a very metaphor of may
your loveliness on my life's sombre grey
in its perfection stands out doubly bright
and yet your beauty breeds a strange despair
and pang of yearning in the helpless heart
to shield you from time's fraying wear and tear
that from yourself yourself would wrench apart
how save you fairest but to set you where
mortality kills death in deathless art
the storm which shook the silence of the hills
and sleeping pinnacles of ancient snow
went muttering off in one last thunder throe
mixed with a moan of multitudinous rills
yea even as one who has wept much but stills
the flowing tears of some convulsive woe
when a fair light of hope begins to glow
athwart the gloom of long remembered ills
so does the face of this scarred mountain height
relax its stony frown while slow uprolled
invidious mists are changed to veiling gold
wild peaks still fluctuate between dark and bright
but when the sun laughs at them as of old
they kiss high heaven in all embracing light
in tortuous windings up the steep incline
the sombre street toils to the village square
whose antique walls in stone and moulding bear
dumb witness to the moor afar off shine
with tier on tier cutting heaven's blue divine
the snowy alps and lower the hills are fair
with wave green olives rippling down to where
gold clusters hang and leaves of sunburnt vine
you may perchance i never shall forget
when between twofold glory of land and sea
we leant together o'er the old parapet
and saw the sun go down for oh to me
the beauty of that beautiful strange place
was its reflection beaming from your face
as opiates to the sick on wakeful nights
as light to flowers as flowers in poor men's rooms
as to the fisher when the tempest glooms
the cheerful twinkling of his village lights
as emerald isles to flagging swallow flights
as roses garlanding with tendrilled blooms
the unweeded hillocks of forgotten tombs
as singing birds on cypress shadowed heights
thou art to me  a comfort past compare
for thy joy kindling presence sweet as may
sets all my nerves to music makes away
with sorrow and the numbing frost of care
until the influence of thine eyes' bright sway
has made life's glass go up from foul to fair
peace throbbing heart nor let us shed one tear
o'er this late love's unseasonable glow
sweet as a violet blooming in the snow
the posthumous offspring of the widowed year
that smells of march when all the world is sere
and while around the hurtling sea winds blow
which twist the oak and lay the pine tree low
stands childlike in the storm and has no fear
poor helpless blossom orphaned of the sun
how could it thus brave winter's rude estate
oh love more helpless why bloom so late
now that the flower time of the year is done
since thy dear course must end when scarce begun
nipped by the cold touch of relentless fate
no breath of wind stirs in the painted leaves
the meadows are as stirless as the sky
like a saint's halo golden vapours lie
above the restful valley's garnered sheaves
the journeying sun like one who fondly grieves
above the hills seems loitering with a sigh
as loth to bid the fruitful earth good bye
on these hushed hours of luminous autumn eves
there is a pathos in his softening glow
which like a benediction seems to hover
o'er the tranced earth ere he must sing below
and leave her widowed of her radiant lover
a frost bound sleeper in a shroud of snow
while winter winds howl a wild dirge above her
alone  with one fair star for company
the loveliest star among the hosts of night
while the grey tide ebbs with the ebbing light
i pace along the darkening wintry sea
now round the yule log and the glittering tree
twinkling with festive tapers eyes as bright
sparkle with christmas joys and young delight
as each one gathers to his family
but i  a waif on earth where'er i roam
uprooted with life's bleeding hopes and fears
from that one heart that was my heart's sole home
feel the old pang pierce through the severing years
and as i think upon the years to come
that fair star trembles through my falling tears
wan mists enwrap the still born day
the harebell withers on the heath
and all the moorland seems to breathe
the hectic beauty of decay
within the open grave of may
dishevelled trees drop wreath on wreath
wind wrung and ravelled underneath
waste leaves choke up the woodland way
the grief of many partings near
wails like an echo in the wind
the days of love lie far behind
the days of loss lie shuddering near
life's morning glory who shall bind
it is the evening of the year
another full orbed year hath waned to day
and set in the irrevocable past
and headlong whirled long time's winged blast
my fluttering rose of youth is borne away
ah rose once crimson with the blood of may
a honeyed haunt where bees would break their fast
i watch thy scattering petals flee aghast
and all the flickering rose lights turning grey
poor fool of life plagued ever with thy vain
regrets and futile longings were the years
not cups o'erbrimming still with gall and tears
let go thy puny personal joy and pain
if youth with all its brief hope disappears
to deathless hope we must be born again
divest thyself o soul of vain desire
bid hope farewell dismiss all coward fears
take leave of empty laughter emptier tears
and quench for ever quench the wasting fire
wherein this heart as in a funeral pyre
aye burns yet is consumed not years on years
moaning with memories in thy maddened ears
let at thy word like refluent waves retire
enter thy soul's vast realm as sovereign lord
and like that angel with the flaming sword
wave off life's clinging hands then chains will fall
from the poor slave of self's hard tyranny
and thou a ripple rounded by the sea
in rapture lost be lapped within the all
what are these things thou lovest vanity
to see men turn their heads when thou dost pass
to be the signboard and the looking glass
where every idler there may glut his eye
to hear men speak thy name mysteriously
wagging their heads is it for this alas
that thou hast made a placard of a face
on which the tears of love were hardly dry
what are these things thou lovest the applause
of prostitutes at wit which is not thine
the sympathy of shop boys who would weep
their shilling's worth of woe in any cause
at any tragedy  their tears and mine
what difference oh truly tears are cheap
if i had chosen thee thou shouldst have been
a virgin proud untamed immaculate
chaste as the morning star a saint a queen
scarred by no wars no violence of hate
thou shouldst have been of soul commensurate
with thy fair body brave and virtuous
and kind and just and if of poor estate
at least an honest woman for my house
i would have had thee come of honoured blood
and honourable nurture thou shouldst bear
sons to my pride and daughters to my heart
and men should hold thee happy wise and good
lo thou art none of this but only fair
yet must i love thee dear and as thou art
oh leave the past to bury its own dead
the past is naught to us the present all
what need of last year's leaves to strew love's bed
what need of ghosts to grace a festival
i would not if i could those days recall
those days not ours for us the feast is spread
the lamps are lit and music plays withal
then let us love and leave the rest unsaid
this island is our home around it roar
great gulfs and oceans channels straits and seas
what matter in what wreck we reached the shore
so we both reached it we can mock at these
oh leave the past if past indeed there be
i would not know it i would know but thee
why do we fret at the inconstancy
of our frail hearts which cannot always love
time rushes onward and we mortals move
like waifs upon a river neither free
to halt or hurry sweet if destiny
throws us together for an hour a day
in the backwater of this quiet bay
let us rejoice before us lies the sea
where we must all be lost in spite of love
we dare not stop to question happiness
lies in our hand unsought a treasure trove
time has short patience of man's vain distress
and fate grows angry at too long delay
and floods rise fast and we are swept away
lame impotent conclusion to youth's dreams
vast as all heaven see what glory lies
entangled here in these base stratagems
what virtue done to death o glorious sighs
sublime beseechings high cajoleries
fond wraths brave raptures all that sometime was
our daily bread of gods beneath the skies
how are ye ended in what utter loss
time was time is and time is yet to come
till even time itself shall have an end
these were eternal  and behold a tomb
come let us laugh and eat and drink god send
what all the world must need one day as we
speedy oblivion rest for memory
when i complained that i had lost my hope
of life eternal with eternal god
when i refused to read my horoscope
in the unchanging stars or claim abode
with powers and dominations  but poor clod
clung to the earth and grovelled in my tears
because i soon must lie beneath the sod
and close the little number of my years
then i was told that pride had barred the way
and raised this foul rebellion i but yesterday
was god's own son in his own likeness bred
and thrice strange pride who thus am cast away
and go forth lost and disinherited
if i could live without the thought of death
forgetful of time's waste the soul's decay
i would not ask for other joy than breath
with light and sound of birds and the sun's ray
i could sit on untroubled day by day
watching the grass grow and the wild flowers range
from blue to yellow and from red to grey
in natural sequence as the seasons change
i could afford to wait but for the hurt
of this dull tick of time which chides my ear
but now i dare not sit with loins ungirt
and staff unlifted for death stands too near
i must be up and doing  ay each minute
the grave gives time for rest when we are in it
to stand upon a windy pinnacle
beneath the infinite blue of the blue noon
and underfoot a valley terrible
as that dim gulf where sense and being swoon
when the soul parts a giant valley strewn
with giant rocks asleep and vast and still
and far away the torrent which has hewn
his pathway through the entrails of the hill
now crawls along the bottom and anon
lifts up his voice a muffled tremulous roar
borne on the wind an instant and then gone
back to the caverns of the middle air
a voice as of a nation overthrown
with beat of drums when hosts have marched to war
lear and cordelia 't was an ancient tale
before thy shakespeare gave it deathless fame
the times have changed the moral is the same
so like an outcast dowerless and pale
thy daughter went and in a foreign gale
spread her young banner till its sway became
a wonder to the nations days of shame
are close upon thee prophets raise their wail
when the rude cossack with an outstretched hand
points his long spear across the narrow sea
lo there is england when thy destiny
storms on thy straw crowned head and thou dost stand
weak helpless mad a by word in the land
god grant thy daughter a cordelia be
stand thou great bulwark of man's liberty
thou rock of shelter rising from the wave
sole refuge to the overwearied brave
who planned arose and battled to be free
fell undeterred then sadly turned to thee
saved the free spirit from their country's grave
to rise again and animate the slave
when god shall ripen all things britons ye
who guard the sacred outpost not in vain
hold your proud peril freemen undefiled
keep watch and ward let battlements be piled
around your cliffs fleets marshalled till the main
sinks under them and if your courage wane
through force or fraud look westward to your child
where is my merit by what special grace
am i so blessed above all other men
i have some fancy and the art to pen
a halting sonnet to thy perfect face
but what of that the thrush or twittering wren
makes sweeter music from his resting place
no outward beauty in my life i trace
no thought or deed heroical and when
my eyes turn inward i am stricken blind
at the abyss of weakness folly sin
that like a miner's shaft sinks far within
my darkened nature nowhere can i find
cause for thy love rest rest my troubled mind
where reason stops let soaring faith begin
i strive to live my life in whitest truth
even in the face of this deceitful world
and if in errors i am caught and whirled
from the fair courses of my candid youth
i view my trespasses with thoughtful ruth
and the poor mummer's scornful lip is curled
and a low curse indignantly is hurled
at arts which others blindly take as sooth
but when i enter thy pure presence sweet
i come as one into a holy shrine
i taste the mystic wafer and the wine
and fraud and falsehood from my heart retreat
through thy divinity i grow divine
and my world's mask lies empty at thy feet
nothing is stable though the deeds we do
may bind the nations in a servile chain
and give to cowering slaves their joy and pain
the far result still frowns in open view
a little wound will let great caesar through
an asp make egypt's dusky charmer plain
and all the power and beauty that remain
go shivering naked up the mystic blue
earth smiles at tyrants when the crown is laid
upon the coffin and their history
to after times with laughter is displayed
death and oblivion are the proudest fee
of men's endeavor and the delver's spade
rounds all our hillocks fair and evenly
when with the courage lent me by thy smile
i laid my hands upon thy sacred form
dared passion wild thy scented mouth to warm
with cleaving kisses unrepelled the while
was it thy patience or my venturous guile
shook virtue's outworks with a fiery storm
and made her guards the trembling ramparts swarm
to meet a foe who came in friendly stile
i know not love but since that trustful day
i grow more careful of myself less stained
by worldly touch as though that touch profaned
i am all thine more like thee if thou'lt say
those kisses brushed thy purese bloom away
say also this that what thou lost i gained
love sat at ease upon time's bony knee
pulled his grey beard paddled his finger tips
among his wrinkles smote his bloodless lips
with rosy palms forbade his eyes to see
o'erturned his fatal hour glass wantonly
pulled his scythe edge against that dart which rips
the heart of adamant cast gibes and quips
straight in his teeth out mocking mockery
what said this phantom nought he only smiled
to be thus toyed with held his wasting breath
lest he might do some damage to the child
till love grown weary of that pastime saith
this is too tame my heart with joy is wild
come father come let us go play with death
it was a stormy night in early spring
long after sunset pale green rifts of light
gleamed in the west changing to vitreous white
and when these faded darkness was a thing
strangely portentous there went whirring wing
low in the air of birds in furious flight—
wild fowls blown from their courses in the night
it was an eve for spectral imaging
a sinless maiden in her chamber high
that easter advent midnight heard a call
arise arise and startled from her bed
she saw a glory burst along the sky
it lit with flame the cross upon her wall
and through the splendor crimson rain was shed
summer is routed from her rosy plains
the splendid queen with colors flying fled
far to the south leaving her legions dead
upon the fields all in the dismal rains
the minstrels of her camp most plaintive strains
piped as they flew then vandal armies spread
about the hills their tattered tents of red
and gold and purple and their gaudy trains
usurped the valleys firing as they went
till halted by a cordon of grim pines
that would not yield nor furl their banners green
wounded they fought and moaned though wellnigh spent
with blood drops trickling down their chevron vines
they fought and stood—the old guard of their queen
her faded form now glides before my view her plaintive voice now floats upon the gale  the hope how vain that time should bring relief time does but deeper root a real grief
bright crispeacuted threads of pure translucent gold
ye who were wont with zephyr's breath to play
over the warm cheek and ivory forehead stray
or clasp her neck in many an amorous fold
now motionless in this little shrine must hold
no more to wanton in the eye of day
or to the breeze your changeful hues display
for ever still inanimate and cold
poor poor last relic of an angel's face
sad setting ray  no more thy orb is seen
o beauty's pattern miracle of grace
must this be all that tells what thou hast been
come then cold crystal on this bosom lie
till love and grief and fond remembrance die
life's summer flown the wint'ry tempest rude
began to lower on the declining year
when smiles celestial gilt the prospect drear
dispell'd the gloom and joyful spring renew'd
fresh flowers beneath her fairy feet were strew'd
again soft accents woo'd the enchanted ear
in her bright form as in a mirrour clear
reflected each gay scene of life view'd
young in her youth and graceful in her grace
in her's i lived o'er every joy again
lived o'er the charms that beam'd upon her face
where hope and love revived their smiling train
night o'er the scene her blackest veil has spread
and death's pale hand a tenfold horrour shed
why died i not before that fatal morn
that thunder'd in mine ears thy child is gone
thy joys are fled to heaven thy hope is done
and thy few days to come are all forlorn
why when the stroke too heavy to be borne
had smote affrighted reason from her throne
and life's chill power suspended why too soon
did the warm current to its course return
twice twenty summer suns had roll'd away
and seen my hours a clear smooth surface flow
prepared already nature's debt to pay
scarce would my head have shrunk beneath the blow
why now in misery do i lingering stay
while happiness foregone but mocks my woe
did i not weep for him that was in pain
was not my hand still open to distress
when did my harden'd heart the weak oppress
or misery tell her plaintive tale in vain
did ever crime this bleeding bosom stain
or injured sufferer claim unpaid redress
envy or hate or pride my soul possess
o wounded truth of broken laws complain
fate to my humble hopes one blessing gave
and no new gift my grateful breast required
o heaven the object of my love but save
was the sole boon my pious prayers desired
why then has angry heaven atone dire blow
for ever laid my sorrowing head so low
death thy cold hand the brightest flower has chill'd
that e'er suffused love's cheek with rosy dies
quench'd the soft radiance of the loveliest eyes
and accents tuned to sweetest music still'd
the springing buds of hope and pleasure kill'd
joy's cheerful measures changed to doleful sighs
of fairest form and fairest mind the ties
for ever rent in twain  so heaven has will'd
though in the bloom of health thy arrow fled
sudden as sure  long had prophetic dread
hung o'er my heart and all my thoughts depress'd
oft when in flowery wreaths i saw her dress'd
a beauteous victim seemed to meet my eyes
to early fate a destined sacrifice
what art thou life the shadow of a dream
the past and future dwell in thought alone
the present ere we note its flight is gone
and all ideal vain fantastick seem
whence is thy source and whither dost thou tend
so short thy period and thy form so frail
poor prisoner pent in death's surrounding vale
born but to breathe to suffer and to end
why shadow bring'st thou on thy raven wing
dark trains of grief and visions of the night
rather than graces robed in purple light
elysian flowers and love's unclouded spring
since sad or gay whatever be thy theme
death surely ends at once the dreamer and the dream
well has thy classick chisel banks express'd
the graceful lineaments of that fine form
which late with conscious living beauty warm
now here beneath does in dread silence rest
and oh while life shall agitate my breast
recorded there exists her every charm
in vivid colours safe from change or harm
till my last sigh unalter'd love attest
that form as fair as ever fancy drew
the marble cold inanimate retains
but of the radiant smile that round her threw
joys that beguiled my soul of mortal pains
and each divine expression's varying hue
a little senseless dust alone remains
dear mansergh of the few this breast who share
and share in pitying sympathy its woe
you best my vast excess of passion know
and all the sorrow i am doom'd to bear
while thoughts can present with the past compare
shall memory e'er that summer day forego
when thy fair mate did every care bestow
and vermeil fruits and fragrant wreaths prepare
in honour of my child to dress the bower
and when the sweet epitome of grace
tripp'd o'er the walks and honied every flower
you mark'd the opening beauties of her face
mark'd how my captured soul was lost in love
and trembled for the dire reverse i prove
in this suave pause of music the rich air
throbs with a breathless deep expectancy
of mingling momently with melody
dark wine in water reeling rosy rare
beneath the hands of the enraptured player
the cadence of rithmic silence pulses by
till viol and voice light birds soft poised to fly
tremble to life like wind touched sunlit hair
as a cool charm of tinkling water calls
from some old shady garden in hot noons
the clavichord's slow plashing intervals
through the hushed chamber drop their moon clear tones
their calm of music down the long years falls
the golden voice of silence in crystal swoons
your immemorial stream is as your eyes
languid to stillness deep and dark as death
its inner waters nothing wakenethmdash
no thrill of sorrow shatters in any wise
their heavy lidded quiet memories
swoon and are lost therein all perisheth
save the delight of death without a breath
to trouble those pools wherein oblivion lies
rich is your ceaseless poppy harvesting
as on your unremembered path you stray
meet flowers for the sorry garlanding
of proserpine reft from the world away
ease and forgetting do such coronals bring
in their imperious odour's dreamy sway
mysterious mother what intensitude
of vision makes you minister heedlessly
to this your child do shadows prophesy
sorrows for him on some incredible rood
or on your exaltation do you brood
blessed above women seeking to clarify
heaven's inmost aureole and satisfy
your wonderings upon god's womanhood
many ah many mothers worn with care
have wept for unrecorded calvaries
can any passion or tears or sobbing prayer
shake you or will you watch his agonies
sitting as when you knew his messenger
with implicate hands inviolable eyes
didst say genoa ah well perchance 'tis true
i never dreamed that any genoese
had such stern eyes like steadfast haughty seas
assured of sovranty canst say she knew
nought of that glowing city where surely grew
this tolerant calm this strong inviolate ease
this proud epitome of veronese
and sister of titian's girl whom palma drew
although her bodice fails her noble breasts
she grudged no silks to swell her ducal gown
her maritime and many nationed mart
had store of pearls to string the coil that rests
pale in her hair or darkly trickles down
her bosom whose limpid veil droops wide apart
rare lionardo's fair dead florentine
still mid her faery rocks doth darkly smile
the ages down whilst many an ancient wile
lights up her eyes like sunlight in old wine
she glows in that faint land of strange design
sole set like some ensorcelled languid isle
in evil fairness mid a sea of guile
with pitiless features calmed to seem benign
one smiles on me in stillness yesterday
as lisa smiles upon me from the past
until this later world seemed spent and grey
ah lady whispered i didst ever taste
thy painter's lips what love words did he say
know'st though no songs of thine encomiast
you are soon tired indeed to let me go
ere girlhood's light has faded in my eyesmdash
nay i forget what makes me sadly wisemdash
i think you never loved me as i loved you
see take your ring for token that we two
unsay our troths and part and simply part
as though we never whispered heart near heart
in ignorance so many lives ago
we cannot be more strange than we have been
more lonely or more hopeless or more dead
by night and night like day so wearily
will you know her better than you knew me
i wonder when as i did she shall lean
out from my chair near you to rest her head

omar the roses blossom by your grave
and as the cool night winds their petals lave
i hear your roses singing in the dark
dove murmuring this fragmentary stave
our life is from the earth that once was you
perchance in us your soul doth surge anew
o poet but we fall and leave no mark
and only fatten earth as you did too
all ends in death which is the seed of life
for earth again shall make your roses rife
mourn not the fleeting flower a transient spark
flung from the immanent fire's unending strife
the dream winds swoon the roses sing no more
omar above your grave in naishapucircr
they sell them by the odeacuteon in paris yonder
these scattered petals of that rich bloom japan
deep jewels are crushed to stain each porcelain plan
great unfamiliar flowers are torn asunder
high tinted and bright pollened a sunrise splendour
to paint these men fantastic serious wan
exotic drowsy women of sash and fan
and ivory girls with almond eyes of wonder
here's one a lady walks grey meads somewhere
in rosy skirts that curl extravagantly
and a green robe where clematis seems to diemdash
some primavera vision gone astray
neath pink pale curds of may bloom in the air
sleep unimportant legends rose and grey
since in the ashen nunnery of your heart
you shun the love your glories must excite
then choose some white walled convent's better part
and shine the moon of its unthankful night
there in your cold entrancing holiness
i'll love you still all signt of you denied
there for my sake harsh macerations press
close to the bone and die beatifiedmdash
for then those sweets that bind me to the earth
shall charm my thoughts to heavenly excellence
to reach the measure of your high purposed worth
and know your bosom's paradisal sense
i'll kiss your image with exaltation faint
and kneel before you for my patron saint
sweet coz i thank you for your prudish vow
and its oppressive honourable weight
that bade you flout the youth whose costly show
of love might make even you importunate
in the walled garden of my vestal thoughts
i loitered coldly happy purely pale
when lo carnation bearing love's mad notes
came thrush clear past a whitethorn's truthless veil
i take your leavings gladly having learned
that christ's feast scraps are savoured as his feast
fair saintly coward she who never burned
with earthly passion knows of heaven the leastmdash
i'll not despise your poor virginity
that spites itself and so enriches me
he wanders down the winding woodland ways
half faltering in the green dusk's doubtful shiver
until at last by some forgotten river
he meets a woman with his own sad face
sharpened as if by death clad in a grace
of garments ashen green leaf tremulous
his imaged eyes are lingering amorous
yet tear worn as with writhen mouth he says
i meet my soul a walking here beneath
this dim oppression of stifling greenerymdash
for to my desolate lovelessness it seems
the soul of man is fashioned womanlymdash
and nought is in her aspect core o' my dreams
save sweet sinister promises of death
quiet transmuter of spring's vernant wealth
to slight down fluttering flakes of crispegraved gold
linger awhile amid such glowing spilth
in shivering woodland over windy wold
ere like a woman sad past hope of tears
who wends along the dull and weary way
that opens through her few remaining years
wimpled and clad in weed of cheerless grey
thou lapse mist girt from day to short lived day
sped by the rain filled blast's chill clammy breath
o'er plashy roads reddened with leafy clay
till winter crowns the enfeebled year with deathmdash
then down the vista of the departed years
join shadowy seasons shedding unheeded tears
we seek you in the garden to and fro
thinking how often 'twas your loved abode
we gather heartsease from the seed you sowed
and every blossom seems a gift from you
then we remember your hushed bed and go
where rosemary and roses round you strewed
droop tenderly as though for sorrow bowed
while dreams of girlhood smooth your white worn brow
o lately lost and always unforgot
come oft unseen and sit with us again
and soothe us with your old benignity
we cannot think you share not in our lot
for here your heart was when you were not nigh
and all our hearts are with you now as then
turn with me from the city's clamorous street
where throng and push passions and lusts and hate
and enter through this age browned ivied gate
for many summers' birds a sure retreat
the place of perfect peace and here most meet
for meditation where no idle prate
of the world's ways may come rest thee and wait
'tis very quiet thus doth still heaven entreat
with rev'rent feet his face so worn so fair
walks one who bears the cross who waits the crown
tumult is past in those calm eyes i see
the image of the master christ alone
and from those patient lips i hear one prayer
dear lord dear lord that i may be like
o time who know'st a lenient hand to lay
softest on sorrow's wound and slowly thence
lulling to sad repose the weary sense
the faint pang stealest unperceived away
on thee i rest my only hope at last
and think when thou hast dried the bitter tear
that flows in vain o'er all my soul held dear
i may look back on every sorrow past
and meet life's peaceful evening with a smile
as some lone bird at day's departing hour
sings in the sunbeam of the transient shower
forgetful though its wings are wet the while
yet ah how much must that poor heart endure
which hopes from thee and thee alone a cure
beautiful landscape i could look on thee
for hours  unmindful of the storm and strife
and mingled murmurs of tumultuous life
here all is still as fair  the stream the tree
the wood the sunshine on the bank no tear
no thought of time's swift wing or closing night
which comes to steal away the long sweet light
no sighs of sad humanity are here
here is no tint of mortal change  the day
beneath whose light the dog and peasant boy
gambol with look and almost bark of joy
still seems though centuries have passed to stay
then gaze again that shadowed scenes may teach
lessons of peace and love beyond all speech
go then and join the murmuring city's throng
me thou dost leave to solitude and tears
to busy phantasies and boding fears
lest ill betide thee but 't will not be long
ere the hard season shall be past till then
live happy sometimes the forsaken shade
remembering and these trees now left to fade
nor mid the busy scenes and hum of men
wilt thou my cares forget in heaviness
to me the hours shall roll weary and slow
till mournful autumn past and all the snow
of winter pale the glad hour i shall bless
that shall restore thee from the crowd again
to the green hamlet on the peaceful plain
fallen pile i ask not what has been thy fate
but when the winds slow wafted from the main
through each rent arch like spirits that complain
come hollow to my ear i meditate
on this world's passing pageant and the lot
of those who once majestic in their prime
stood smiling at decay till bowed by time
or injury their early boast forgot
they may have fallen like thee pale and forlorn
their brow besprent with thin hairs white as snow
they lift still unsubdued as they would scorn
this short lived scene of vanity and woe
whilst on their sad looks smilingly they bear
the trace of creeping age and the pale hue of care
how sweet the tuneful bells' responsive peal
as when at opening dawn the fragrant breeze
touches the trembling sense of pale disease
so piercing to my heart their force i feel
and hark with lessening cadence now they fall
and now along the white and level tide
they fling their melancholy music wide
bidding me many a tender thought recall
of summer days and those delightful years
when by my native streams in life's fair prime
the mournful magic of their mingling chime
first waked my wondering childhood into tears
but seeming now when all those days are o'er
the sounds of joy once heard and heard no more
milton our noblest poet in the grace
of youth in those fair eyes and clustering hair
that brow untouched by one faint line of care
to mar its openness we seem to trace
the front of the first lord of the human race
mid thine own paradise portrayed so fair
ere sin or sorrow scathed it such the air
that characters thy youth shall time efface
these lineaments as crowding cares assail
it is the lot of fallen humanity
what boots it armed in adamantine mail
the unconquerable mind and genius high
right onward hold their way through weal and woe
or whether life's brief lot be high or low
and art thou he now fallen on evil days
and changed indeed yet what do this sunk cheek
these thinner locks and that calm forehead speak
a spirit reckless of man's blame or praise
a spirit when thine eyes to the noon's blaze
their dark orbs roll in vain in suffering meek
as in the sight of god intent to seek
mid solitude or age or through the ways
of hard adversity the approving look
of its great master whilst the conscious pride
of wisdom patient and content to brook
all ills to that sole master's task applied
shall show before high heaven the unaltered mind
milton though thou art poor and old and blind
it was morn and beauteous on the mountain's brow
hung with the clusters of the bending vine
shone in the early light when on the rhine
we bounded and the white waves round the prow
in murmurs parted  varying as we go
lo the woods open and the rocks retire
as some grey convent wall or glistening spire
mid the bright landscape's track unfolding slow
here dark with furrowed aspect like despair
frowns the bleak cliff there on the woodland's side
the shadowy sunshine pours its gleaming tide
whilst hope enchanted with the scene so fair
counts not the hours of a long summer's day
nor heeds how fast the prospect winds away
o stay harmonious and sweet sounds that die
in the long vaultings of this ancient fane
stay for i may not hear on earth again
those pious airs  that glorious harmony
lifting the soul to brighter orbs on high
worlds without sin or sorrow ah the strain
has died  even the last sounds that lingeringly
hung on the roof ere they expired
stand in the world of strife amidst a throng
a throng that reckons not of death or sin
oh jarring scenes to cease indeed ere long
the worm hears not the discord and the din
but he whose heart thrills to this angel song
feels the pure joy of heaven on earth begin
wild child of genius with his witching lyre
dreamer of dreams of rarest fantasy
upon the earth he flashed with meteor fire
and in his wake rolled waves of melody
seraphic songs as if from heaven's choir
with elfin music weird and mystical
bewitching notes that golden thoughts inspire
angelic strains divinely musical
all praise be his on this his natal day
may all his faults and frailties be forgot
lay laurels on his tomb and honours pay
think only of the glory that he wrought
hail sister nation for thy great son's sake
a kindred soul to keats and burns and blake
within the rose i found a trembling tear
close curtained in a gloom of crimson night
by tender petals from the outer light
i plucked the flower and held it to my ear
and thought within its fervid breast to hear
a smothered heart beat throbbing soft and low
i heard its busy life blood gently flow
now far away and now so strangely near
ah thought i if these silent lips of flame
could be unsealed and fling into the air
their woe their passion and in speech proclaim
their warm intoxication of despair
then would i give the rose into thy hand
thou couldst its voice beloved not withstand
how can i lightly speak thy wondrous name
which breathes the airy fragrance of thyself
as might far straying from his flower the elf
hold yet a breath within his fragile frame
of the flower's soul betraying whence he came
i too beloved though we stray apart
since in the vestal temple of thy heart
i dwell secure glow with a sacred flame
a breath of thy sweet self unto me clings
a wondrous voice as of large unborn deeds
with deep resoundings through my being rings
and unto wider realms of vision leads
and dead to me are sorrow doubt and pain
the slumbering god within me wakes again
i cannot reach thee we are far so far
apart who are so dear
else we might press so close we should notgrow
one doth deny even this so swet a bar
for fear our souls' true shape should suffer mar
ah surface sundered yet do we not know
a hidden union in the deeps below
an intertwining where the strong roots are
wise husbandmen plant thus sweetheart—a space
between the trees but after soon or late
high in the sunny air their spreading boughs
reach forth and meet in some celestial place
when we two are grown tall and fair and straight
we shall clasp hands again—if god allows
how still the room is but a while ago
the sound of sobbing voices vexed my ears
and on my face there fell a rain of tears
i scarce knew why or whence but now i know
for this sweet speaking silence this surcease
of the dumb desperate struggle after breath
this painless consciousness of perfect peace
which fills the place of anguish  it is death
what folly to have feared it not the best
of all we knew of life can equal this
blending in one the sense of utter rest
the vivid certainty of boundless bliss
o death the loveliness that is in thee
could the world know the world would cease to be
what sudden bird will bring us any cheer
whose song in the chill dawn gives hope of spring
can we be glad to give it welcoming
though april in its music be so near
not while the burden of our memories bear
the weight of silence that we know will cling
about the lips that nevermore will sing
the heart of him with visions voiced so clear
there is a pause in meeting before speech
between men who have fed their souls with song
the strangeness of an echo beyond reach
cleaves silence deep for speech to pass along
there are no words to tell the loss but each
of our hearts feels the sorrow deep and strong
the wondersmith in vocables is dead
the builder of the palaces of rhyme
shall build no more his music out of time
in the deep breathless peace to which he fled
he sits with landor's hands upon his head
watching our suns and stars that sink and climb
between him and our tears' continuous chime
sorrowing for his presence vanishèd
aldrich is dead but the glory of his life
is in his song and this will keep his name
safe above change and the assaults of strife
poet whose artistry his constant aim
kept true above defections that were rife
death taking him still leaves his deathless fame
beneath the bare boughed cambridge elms to day
time takes no flight in his unwintered heart
where fourscore years and three came to depart
the vision shines that cannot burn away
in perils of change his voice is still our stay
who kept the true direction from the start
he knew no deed born from his thoughts apart
and held his pen truth's summons to obey
o reverend head take this our crown of praise
on this thy birthday hallowed by our love
a soldier's honor and a poet's bays
in public heed thy virtues held to prove
though long we wish thee longer length of days
to lead us up the heights where we would move
he heard the four winds and the seven seas
and voices inland under alien stars
and drove ambition like auroral cars
striking the hill tops when the darkness flees
vain in his dreams but brave in his vanities
no carpet knight yet versed in parlor wars
and half a rogue when honesty debars
the desire to take the prize his fancy sees
and yet he knew the silences of speech
the leaf heard utterance of april rains
the echoes in the twilight out of reach
beyond the dim horizon where it wanes
and like the distant sea wash on the beach
he sang a few sad tender lyric strains
sometimes when all the world seems gray and dun
and nothing beautiful a voice will cry
look out look out angels are drawing nigh
then my slow burdens leave me one by one
and swiftly does my heart arise and run
even like a child while loveliness goes by
and common folk seem children of the sky
and common things seem shapeacuted of the sun
oh pitiful that i who love them must
so soon perceive their shining garments fade
and slowly slowly from my eyes of trust
their flaming banners sink into a shade
while this earth's sunshine seems the golden dust
slow settling from that radiant cavalcade
fatigue itself may be a pleasant thing
and weariness be silken soft and fine
upon my eyes its little vapors shine
trailing me softly like a colored wing
tender as when beloveacuted voices sing
it steals upon me and with touch divine
lulls all my senses till each thought of mine
is hushed to quiet unremembering
oh weariness thrice dear so frailly spun
of ended pleasure that still shines and glows
oh weariness thrice dear what have i done
to earn this delicate and deep repose
child thou hast worshiped at the setting sun
and looked long long upon the opening rose
wounded am i yet happier  happier far
than they who have not felt the precious sting
poor feet that bleed not with this wandering
poor hands that burn not plucking at a star
poor hearts unblessed and whole i bear the scar
of a too piercing loveliness the thing
hung out of reach i touched and now i sing
mad with delight more blessed than others are
for since the blushing and ethereal hour
when loveliness upon my heart was born
when i was stricken by her magic power
i run  i run  wild ecstasied forlorn
for beauty when i go to pluck her flower
pierces my willing bosom with a thorn
when i am weary for delight and spent
even as a bird that tries too long its wings
will nest awhile amid the grass and sings
so i drop downward from the wonderment
of timelessness and space in which were blent
the wind the sunshine and the wanderings
of all the planets  to the little things
that are my grass and flowers and am content
or if in flight my wings should beat so far
from the kind grass that is so cool and deep
that it must poise among the winds on high
yet will i sing to thee from star to star
piercing thy sunshine and will always keep
a song for thee amid the farthest sky
when i before the altars of repose
invited slumber she refused to stay
but with a broken heart she turned away
astonished quite among the flaunting shows
that circled round she perished like a rose
cast among flames oh bring her back  i pray
then sternly to my heart a voice said nay
thou canst not have her  tearfully she goes
god might not join us  for gorgeous bright
adorned conspicuous sure without disguise
strangely illumined with derisive light
they danced    they danced oh then i was made wise
my foolish deeds flaming before my eyes
denied me slumber all the livelong night
when with her clouds the early dawn illumes
our doubtful streets wistful they grow and mild
as if a sleeping soul grew happy and smiled
the whole dark city radiantly blooms
pale spires lift their hands above the glooms
like a resurrection delicately wild
and flushed with slumber like a little child
under a mist shines forth the innocent tombs
thus have i seen it from a casement high
as unsubstantial as a dream it grows
is this manhattan virginal and shy
that in a cloud so rapturously glows
ethereal frail and like an opening rose
i see my city with an enlightened eye
has he no country is he of alien breed
is this land not his home oh exiled one
stranger to his own kind where does he run
how he has shamed us for the world to read
oh carrion prowling where this people bleed
grown fat upon disaster hide from the sun
a scornful nation asks what has he done
with the public trust the honor and the need
not him with glorious hand will we indite
patriot statesman in the hall of fame
nor will we let him flee into the night
of safe oblivion but oh  that name
for our sons' sons a moving hand shall write
in scarlet letters on the walls of shame
shame on thee o manhattan whom i love
and shame on me that i have slept away
so many years while thy feet went astray
o thou  that should'st be white as any dove
thou scarlet woman is there no voice to move
no hand to smite us even for this i pray
some terrible scourging that we have let the day
darken around us while we saw thee rove
last night i heard thee cry thy wandering feet
went bleeding by me on thy ruined breast
i saw thee nurse a feeding child of flame
desolate gorgeous frantic along the street
ah how i blushed in the dark that through my rest
i felt the burning garments of thy shame
this day into the fields my steps are led
i cannot heal me there row after row
thousands of daisies radiantly blow
they have not brought from heaven my daily bread
but they are like a prayer too often said
i have forgot their meaning and i go
from the cold rubric of their gold and snow
and the calm ritual all uncomforted
i want the faces faces remote and pale
that surge along the city streets the flood
of reckless ones haggard and spent and frail
excited hungry in this other mood
't is not the words of the faith for which i ail
but to plunge in the fountain of its living blood
fire in the heavens and fire along the hills
and fire made solid in the flinty stone
thick massed or scattered pebble fire that fills
the breathless hour that lives in fire alone
this valley long ago the patient bed
of floods that carved its antient amplitude
in stillness of the egyptian crypt outspread
endures to drown in noon day's tyrant mood
behind the veil of burning silence bound
vast life's innumerous busy littleness
is hushed in vague conjectured blur of sound
that dulls the brain with slumbrous weight unless
some dazzling puncture let the stridence throng
in the cicada's torture point of song
vengeance is mine saith the lord i will repay
ay' verily and by ministry of such men
as did his will upon the saracen
and christendom owns not that man today
who deems it not the holiest task to slay
so utterly that they rise not again
yon blatant heathenrie past human ken
outlawed to death its raving spawn and prey
and thou has lit one flame of love and wrath
who all unterrified didst take thy stand
and tear the beast and baulk him of his spring
o noble belgium lion in the path
an inch of sword holding a foot of land
a folk of men showing a man for king
in the grey dawn i lie within my bed
still as a frozen lake that pats no more
with murmurous delight the o'erhanging shore
yet grim thoughts heave obscurely in my head
for curtains i have earthern walls and lead
is colder than the woollen garb i wore
but oh that heart of mine is still as sore
as when i did not know that i was dead
i knew her o my life and she was fair
and gave her beauty to the hills and sea
the wonder of her voice to leaf and wave
the brown earth lies between us does she care
that since she cast the first dull clod on me
my lonely heart is aching in the grave
gone are the aching want the unceasing fret
mad flight and moaning over battered wings
and self contempt whose secret penance wrings
out of the writhing soul her bloody sweat
but use has never taught me to forget
the glory that the common daylight flings
still in my heart the rebel tocsin rings
and still is love my glowing amulet
calm and contented yet with heart afire
to fight for ever for the sake of strife
i hold the future and the past in fee
the time to come brings riper fruit for me
who stretch my hands with passionate desire
and welcome for the green and grey of life
the sickness of desire that in dark days
looks on the imagination of despair
forgetteth man and stinteth god his praise
nor but in sleep findeth a cure for care
incertainty that once gave scope to dream
of laughing enterprise and glory untold
is now a blackness that no stars redeem
a wall of terror in a night of cold
and now impatiently despairest see
how nought is changed joy's wisdom is attired
splended for others' eyes if not for thee
not love or beauty or youth from earth is fled
if they delite thee not 'tis thou art dead
since now from woodland mist and flooded clay
i am fled beside the steep devonian shore
nor stand for welcome at your gothic door
'neath the fair tower of magdalen and may
such tribute warren as fond poets pay
for generous esteem i write not more
enhearten'd than my need is reckoning o'er
my life long wanderings on the heavenly way
well honour'd honourable and all attain
somewhat by fathering what fortune sends
i bid your presidency a long reign
true friend and may your praise to greater ends
aid better men than i nor me in vain
belov'd of all to whom that muse is dear
who hid her spirit of rapture from the greek
whereby our art excelleth the antique
perfecting formal beauty to the ear
thou that hast been in england many a year
the interpreter who left us nought to seek
making beethoven's inmost passion speak
bringing the soul of great sebastian near
their music liveth ever and 'tis just
that thou good joachim so high thy skill
rank as thou shalt upon the heavenly hill
laurel'd with them for thy ennobling trust
remember'd when thy loving hand is still
and every ear that heard thee stopt with dust
how fares it friend since i by fate annoy'd
left the old home in need of livelier play
for body and mind how fare this many a day
the stubborn thews and ageless heart of floyd
if not too well with country sport employ'd
visit my flock the breezy hill that they
choose for their fold and see for thence you may
from rising walls all roofless yet and void
the mind of the wide landscape dreaming deep
grey silvery in the vale a shrine where keep
memorian hopes their pale celestial fire
like man's immortal conscience of desire
the spirit that watcheth in me ev'n in my sleep
while yet we wait for spring and from the dry
and blackening east that so embitters march
well housed must watch grey fields and meadows parch
and driven dust and withering snowflake fly
already in glimpses of the tarnish'd sky
the sun is warm and beckons to the larch
and where the covert hazels interarch
their tassell'd twigs fair beds of primrose lie
beneath the crisp and wintry carpet hid
a million buds but stay their blossoming
and trustful birds have built their nests amid
the shuddering boughs and only wait to sing
till one soft shower from the south shall bid
and hither tempt the pilgrim steps of spring
in autumn moonlight when the white air wan
is fragrant in the wake of summer hence
'tis sweet to sit entranced and muse thereon
in melancholy and godlike indolence
when the proud spirit lull'd by mortal prime
to fond pretence of immortality
vieweth all moments from the birth of time
all things whate'er have been or yet shall be
and like the garden where the year is spent
the ruin of old life is full of yearning
mingling poetic rapture of lament
with flowers and sunshine of spring's sure returning
only in visions of the white air wan
by godlike fancy seized and dwelt upon
art thou less beautiful or i more dull
o nature once my passion and delight
how shall i win thee is thy promise null
or have i forfeited my ancient right
by me thy skiey splendours are unwatched
by me thy changeful year unheeded flies
glories of sunrise or of eve unmatched
changes but new delights to lovers' eyes
time was i thought that thou to me hadst given
the dearest boon imparted from above
the greener meadow and the bluer heaven
with the deep heart of wonder and of love
but now the sharer of a common lot
i only wonder that i wonder not
working as erst by law not miracle
by genius god doth lift a common soul
to some still spot where it may glimpse the goal
bidding it on the mountain heights to dwell
yet not so far apart but it may tell
to toilers in the plain below the whole
of the vision master still the organ roll
of thy deep music vibrates and its spell
aids the uplift that stirs our grosser clay
to rise and seek the heights o soul god set
a little lower than his white angels yet
a round for man to climb the starward way
thou art one palm with angels' long since met
the other warm in man's grasp still doth stay
no more these passion worn faces shall men's eyes
behold in life death leaves no trace behind
of their wild hate and wilder love grown blind
in desperate longing more than the foam which lies
splashed up awhile where the showered spray descries
the waves whereto their cold limbs were resign'd
yet ever doth the sea wind's undefin'd
vague wailing shudder with their dying sighs
for all men's souls 'twixt sorrow and love are cast
as on the earth each lingers his brief space
while surely nightfall comes where each man's face
in death's obliteration sinks at last
as a deserted wind tossed sea's foam trace
life's chilled boughs emptied by death's autumn blast
i thought once how theocritus had sung
of the sweet years the dear and wished for years
who each one in a gracious hand appears
to bear a gift for mortals old or young
and as i mused it in his antique tongue
i saw in gradual vision through my tears
the sweet sad years the melancholy years
those of my own life who by turns had flung
a shadow across me straightway i was 'ware
so weeping how a mystic shape did move
behind me and drew me backward by the hair
and a voice said in mastery while i strove
guess now who holds thee    death i said but there
the silver answer rang  not death but love
but only three in all god's universe
have heard this word thou hast said  himself beside
thee speaking and me listening and replied
one of us    that was god   and laid the curse
so darkly on my eyelids as to amerce
my sight from seeing thee  that if i had died
the deathweights placed there would have signified
less absolute exclusion nay is worse
from god than from all others o my friend
men could not part us with their worldly jars
nor the seas change us nor the tempests bend
our hands would touch for all the mountain bars
and heaven being rolled between us at the end
we should but vow the faster for the stars
unlike are we unlike o princely heart
unlike our uses and our destinies
our ministering two angels look surprise
on one another as they strike athwart
their wings in passing thou bethink thee art
a guest for queens to social pageantries
with gages from a hundred brighter eyes
than tears even can make mine to play thy part
of chief musician what hast thou to do
with looking from the lattice lights at me
a poor tired wandering singer singing through
the dark and leaning up a cypress tree
the chrism is on thine head  on mine the dew
and death must dig the level where these agree
thou hast thy calling to some palace floor
most gracious singer of high poems where
the dancers will break footing from the care
of watching up thy pregnant lips for more
and dost thou lift this house's latch too poor
for hand of thine and canst thou think and bear
to let thy music drop here unaware
in folds of golden fulness at my door
look up and see the casement broken in
the bats and owlets builders in the roof
my cricket chirps against thy mandolin
hush call no echo up in further proof
of desolation there's a voice within
that weeps    as thou must sing    alone aloof
i lift my heavy heart up solemnly
as once electra her sepulchral urn
and looking in thine eyes i overturn
the ashes at thy feet behold and see
what a great heap of grief lay hid in me
and how the red wild sparkles dimly burn
through the ashen greyness if thy foot in scorn
could tread them out to darkness utterly
it might be well perhaps but if instead
thou wait beside me for the wind to blow
the grey dust up    those laurels on thine head
o my belovegraved will not shield thee so
that none of all the fires shall scorch and shred
the hair beneath stand farther off then go
go from me yet i feel that i shall stand
henceforward in thy shadow nevermore
alone upon the threshold of my door
of individual life i shall command
the uses of my soul nor lift my hand
serenely in the sunshine as before
without the sense of that which i forbore
thy touch upon the palm the widest land
doom takes to part us leaves thy heart in mine
with pulses that beat double what i do
and what i dream include thee as the wine
must taste of its own grapes and when i sue
god for myself he hears that name of thine
and sees within my eyes the tears of two
the face of all the world is changed i think
since first i heard the footsteps of thy soul
move still oh still beside me as they stole
betwixt me and the dreadful outer brink
of obvious death where i who thought to sink
was caught up into love and taught the whole
of life in a new rhythm the cup of dole
god gave for baptism i am fain to drink
and praise its sweetness sweet with thee anear
the names of country heaven are changed away
for where thou art or shalt be there or here
and this    this lute and song    loved yesterday
the singing angels know are only dear
because thy name moves right in what they say
what can i give thee back o liberal
and princely giver who hast brought the gold
and purple of thine heart unstained untold
and laid them on the outside of the wall
for such as i to take or leave withal
in unexpected largesse am i cold
ungrateful that for these most manifold
high gifts i render nothing back at all
not so not cold  but very poor instead
ask god who knows for frequent tears have run
the colours from my life and left so dead
and pale a stuff it were not fitly done
to give the same as pillow to thy head
go farther let it serve to trample on
can it be right to give what i can give
to let thee sit beneath the fall of tears
as salt as mine and hear the sighing years
re sighing on my lips renunciative
through those infrequent smiles which fail to live
for all thy adjurations o my fears
that this can scarce be right we are not peers
so to be lovers and i own and grieve
that givers of such gifts as mine are must
be counted with the ungenerous out alas
i will not soil thy purple with my dust
nor breathe my poison on thy venice glass
nor give thee any love  which were unjust
beloved i only love thee let it pass
yet love mere love is beautiful indeed
and worthy of acceptation fire is bright
let temple burn or flax an equal light
leaps in the flame from cedar plank or weed
and love is fire and when i say at need
i love thee    mark    i love thee  in thy sight
i stand transfigured glorified aright
with conscience of the new rays that proceed
out of my face toward thine there's nothing low
in love when love the lowest meanest creatures
who love god god accepts while loving so
and what i feel across the inferior features
of what i am doth flash itself and show
how that great work of love enhances nature's
and therefore if to love can be desert
i am not all unworthy cheeks as pale
as these you see and trembling knees that fail
to bear the burden of a heavy heart
this weary minstrel life that once was girt
to climb aornus and can scarce avail
to pipe now 'gainst the valley nightingale
a melancholy music  why advert
to these things o belovegraved it is plain
i am not of thy worth nor for thy place
and yet because i love thee i obtain
from that same love this vindicating grace
to live on still in love and yet in vain
to bless thee yet renounce thee to thy face
indeed this very love which is my boast
and which when rising up from breast to brow
doth crown me with a ruby large enow
to draw men's eyes and prove the inner cost
this love even all my worth to the uttermost
i should not love withal unless that thou
hadst set me an example shown me how
when first thine earnest eyes with mine were crossed
and love called love and thus i cannot speak
of love even as a good thing of my own
thy soul hath snatched up mine all faint and weak
and placed it by thee on a golden throne
and that i love o soul we must be meek
is by thee only whom i love alone
and wilt thou have me fashion into speech
the love i bear thee finding words enough
and hold the torch out while the winds are rough
between our faces to cast light on each
i drop at thy feet i cannot teach
my hand to hold my spirit so far off
from myself  me  that i should bring thee proof
in words of love hid in me out of reach
nay let the silence of my womanhood
commend my woman love to thy belief
seeing that i stand unwon however wooed
and rend the garment of my life in brief
by a most dauntless voiceless fortitude
lest one touch of this heart convey its grief
if thou must love me let it be for nought
except for love's sake only do not say
i love her for her smile  her look  her way
of speaking gently  for a trick of thought
that falls in well with mine and certes brought
a sense of pleasant ease on such a day
for these things in themselves beloved may
be changed or change for thee  and love so wrought
may be unwrought so neither love me for
thine own dear pity's wiping my cheeks dry
a creature might forget to weep who bore
thy comfort long and lose thy love thereby
but love me for love's sake that evermore
thou mayst love on through love's eternity
accuse me not beseech thee that i wear
too calm and sad a face in front of thine
for we two look two ways and cannot shine
with the same sunlight on our brow and hair
on me thou lookest with no doubting care
as on a bee shut in a crystalline
since sorrow hath shut me safe in love's divine
and to spread wing and fly in the outer air
were most impossible failure if i strove
to fail so but i look on thee  on thee
beholding besides love the end of love
hearing oblivion beyond memory
as one who sits and gazes from above
over the rivers to the bitter sea
and yet because thou overcomest so
because thou art more noble and like a king
thou canst prevail against my fears and fling
thy purple round me till my heart shall grow
too close against thine heart henceforth to know
how it shook when alone why conquering
may prove as lordly and complete a thing
in lifting upward as in crushing low
and as a vanquished soldier yields his sword
to one who lifts him from the bloody earth
even so belovegraved i at last record
here ends my strife if thou invite me forth
i rise above abasement at the word
make thy love larger to enlarge my worth
my poet thou canst touch on all the notes
god set between his after and before
and strike up and strike off the general roar
of the rushing worlds a melody that floats
in a serene air purely antidotes
of medicated music answering for
mankind's forlornest uses thou canst pour
from thence into their ears god's will devotes
thine to such ends and mine to wait on thine
how dearest wilt thou have me for most use
a hope to sing by gladly or a fine
sad memory with thy songs to interfuse
a shade in which to sing  of palm or pine
a grave on which to rest from singing    choose
i never gave a lock of hair away
to a man dearest except this to thee
which now upon my fingers thoughtfully
i ring out to the full brown length and say
take it my day of youth went yesterday
my hair no longer bounds to my foot's glee
nor plant i it from rose or myrtle tree
as girls do any more it only may
now shade on two pale cheeks the mark of tears
taught drooping from the head that hangs aside
through sorrow's trick i thought the funeral shears
would take this first but love is justified
take it thou  finding pure from all those years
the kiss my mother left here when she died
the soul's rialto hath its merchandise
i barter curl for curl upon that mart
and from my poet's forehead to my heart
receive this lock which outweighs argosies
as purply black as erst to pindar's eyes
the dim purpureal tresses gloomed athwart
the nine white muse brows for this counterpart
the bay crown's shade belovegraved i surmise
still lingers on thy curl it is so black
thus with a fillet of smooth kissing breath
i tie the shadows safe from gliding back
and lay the gift where nothing hindereth
here on my heart as on thy brow to lack
no natural heat till mine grows cold in death
belovegraved my belovegraved when i think
that thou wast in the world a year ago
what time i sat alone here in the snow
and saw no footprint heard the silence sink
no moment at thy voice but link by link
went counting all my chains as if that so
they never could fall off at any blow
struck by thy possible hand  why thus i drink
of life's great cup of wonder wonderful
never to feel thee thrill the day or night
with personal act or speech  nor ever cull
some prescience of thee with the blossoms white
thou sawest growing atheists are as dull
who cannot guess god's presence out of sight
say over again and yet once over again
that thou dost love me though the word repeated
should seem a cuckoo song as thou dost treat it
remember never to the hill or plain
valley and wood without her cuckoo strain
comes the fresh spring in all her green completed
belovegraved i amid the darkness greeted
by a doubtful spirit voice in that doubt's pain
cry speak once more  thou lovest who can fear
too many stars though each in heaven shall roll
too many flowers though each shall crown the year
say thou dost love me love me love me  toll
the silver iterance  only minding dear
to love me also in silence with thy soul
when our two souls stand up erect and strong
face to face silent drawing nigh and nigher
until the lengthening wings break into fire
at either curvegraved point  what bitter wrong
can the earth do to us that we should not long
be here contented  think in mounting higher
the angels would press on us and aspire
to drop some golden orb of perfect song
into our deep dear silence let us stay
rather on earth belovegraved  where the unfit
contrarious moods of men recoil away
and isolate pure spirits and permit
a place to stand and love in for a day
with darkness and the death hour rounding it
is it indeed so if i lay here dead
wouldst thou miss any life in losing mine
and would the sun for thee more coldly shine
because of grave damps falling round my head
i marvelled my belovegraved when i read
thy thought so in the letter i am thine
but    so much to thee can i pour thy wine
while my hands tremble then my soul instead
of dreams of death resumes life's lower range
then love me love look on me  breathe on me
as brighter ladies do not count it strange
for love to give up acres and degree
i yield the grave for thy sake and exchange
my near sweet view of heaven for earth with thee
let the world's sharpness like a clasping knife
shut in upon itself and do no harm
in this close hand of love now soft and warm
and let us hear no sound of human strife
after the click of the shutting life to life
i lean upon thee dear without alarm
and feel as safe as guarded by a charm
against the stab of worldlings who if rife
are weak to injure very whitely still
the lilies of our lives may reassure
their blossoms from their roots accessible
alone to heavenly dews that drop not fewer
growing straight out of man's reach on the hill
god only who made us rich can make us poor
a heavy heart belovegraved have i borne
from year to year until i saw thy face
and sorrow after sorrow took the place
of all those natural joys as lightly worn
as the stringed pearls each lifted in its turn
by a beating heart at dance time hopes apace
were changed to long despairs till god's own grace
could scarcely lift above the world forlorn
my heavy heart then thou didst bid me bring
and let it drop adown thy calmly great
deep being fast it sinketh as a thing
which its own nature doth precipitate
while thine doth close above it mediating
betwixt the stars and the unaccomplished fate
i lived with visions for my company
instead of men and women years ago
and found them gentle mates nor thought to know
a sweeter music than they played to me
but soon their trailing purple was not free
of this world's dust their lutes did silent grow
and i myself grew faint and blind below
their vanishing eyes then thou didst come  to be
belovegraved what they seemed their shining fronts
their songs their splendours better yet the same
as river water hallowed into fonts
met in thee and from out thee overcame
my soul with satisfaction of all wants
because god's gifts put man's best dreams to shame
my own belovegraved who hast lifted me
from this drear flat of earth where i was thrown
and in betwixt the languid ringlets blown
a life breath till the forehead hopefully
shines out again as all the angels see
before thy saving kiss my own my own
who camest to me when the world was gone
and i who looked for only god found thee
i find thee i am safe and strong and glad
as one who stands in dewless asphodel
looks backward on the tedious time he had
in the upper life  so i with bosom swell
make witness here between the good and bad
that love as strong as death retrieves as well
my letters all dead paper mute and white
and yet they seem alive and quivering
against my tremulous hands which loose the string
and let them drop down on my knee to night
this said  he wished to have me in his sight
once as a friend this fixed a day in spring
to come and touch my hand    a simple thing
yet i wept for it  this    the paper's light
said dear i love thee and i sank and quailed
as if god's future thundered on my past
this said i am thine  and so its ink has paled
with lying at my heart that beat too fast
and this    o love thy words have ill availed
if what this said i dared repeat at last
i think of thee  my thoughts do twine and bud
about thee as wild vines about a tree
put out broad leaves and soon there's nought to see
except the straggling green which hides the wood
yet o my palm tree be it understood
i will not have my thoughts instead of thee
who art dearer better rather instantly
renew thy presence as a strong tree should
rustle thy boughs and set thy trunk all bare
and let these bands of greenery which insphere thee
drop heavily down  burst shattered everywhere
because in this deep joy to see and hear thee
and breathe within thy shadow a new air
i do not think of thee  i am too near thee
i see thine image through my tears to night
and yet to day i saw thee smiling how
refer the cause  belovegraved is it thou
or i who makes me sad  the acolyte
amid the chanted joy and thankful rite
may so fall flat with pale insensate brow
on the altar stair i hear thy voice and vow
perplexed uncertain since thou art out of sight
as he in his swooning ears the choir's amen
belovegraved dost thou love or did i see all
the glory as i dreamed and fainted when
too vehement light dilated my ideal
for my soul's eyes   will that light come again
as now these tears come  falling hot and real
thou comest all is said without a word
i sit beneath thy looks as children do
in the noon sun with souls that tremble through
their happy eyelids from an unaverred
yet prodigal inward joy behold i erred
in that last doubt and yet i cannot rue
the sin most but the occasion  that we two
should for a moment stand unministered
by a mutual presence ah keep near and close
thou dovelike help and when my fears would rise
with thy broad heart serenely interpose
brood down with thy divine sufficiencies
these thoughts which tremble when bereft of those
like callow birds left desert to the skies
the first time that the sun rose on thine oath
to love me i looked forward to the moon
to slacken all those bonds which seemed too soon
and quickly tied to make a lasting troth
quick loving hearts i thought may quickly loathe
and looking on myself i seemed not one
for such man's love  more like an out of tune
worn viol a good singer would be wroth
to spoil his song with and which snatched in haste
is laid down at the first ill sounding note
i did not wrong myself so but i placed
a wrong on thee for perfect strains may float
'neath master hands from instruments defaced
and great souls at one stroke may do and dote
yes call me by my pet name let me hear
the name i used to run at when a child
from innocent play and leave the cow slips piled
to glance up in some face that proved me dear
with the look of its eyes i miss the clear
fond voices which being drawn and reconciled
into the music of heaven's undefiled
call me no longer silence on the bier
while i call god  call god  so let thy mouth
be heir to those who are now exanimate
gather the north flowers to complete the south
and catch the early love up in the late
yes call me by that name  and i in truth
with the same heart will answer and not wait
with the same heart i said i'll answer thee
as those when thou shalt call me by my name
lo the vain promise is the same the same
perplexed and ruffled by life's strategy
when called before i told how hastily
i dropped my flowers or brake off from a game
to run and answer with the smile that came
at play last moment and went on with me
through my obedience when i answer now
i drop a grave thought break from solitude
yet still my heart goes to thee  ponder how
not as to a single good but all my good
lay thy hand on it best one and allow
that no child's foot could run fast as this blood
if i leave all for thee wilt thou exchange
and be all to me shall i never miss
home talk and blessing and the common kiss
that comes to each in turn nor count it strange
when i look up to drop on a new range
of walls and floors another home than this
nay wilt thou fill that place by me which is
filled by dead eyes too tender to know change
that's hardest if to conquer love has tried
to conquer grief tries more as all things prove
for grief indeed is love and grief beside
alas i have grieved so i am hard to love
yet love me  wilt thou open thine heart wide
and fold within the wet wings of thy dove
when we met first and loved i did not build
upon the event with marble could it mean
to last a love set pendulous between
sorrow and sorrow nay i rather thrilled
distrusting every light that seemed to gild
the onward path and feared to overlean
a finger even and though i have grown serene
and strong since then i think that god has willed
a still renewable fear   o love o troth
lest these enclaspegraved hands should never hold
this mutual kiss drop down between us both
as an unowned thing once the lips being cold
and love be false if he to keep one oath
must lose one joy by his life's star foretold
pardon oh pardon that my soul should make
of all that strong divineness which i know
for thine and thee an image only so
formed of the sand and fit to shift and break
it is that distant years which did not take
thy sovranty recoiling with a blow
have forced my swimming brain to undergo
their doubt and dread and blindly to forsake
the purity of likeness and distort
thy worthiest love to a worthless counterfeit
as if a shipwrecked pagan safe in port
his guardian sea god to commemorate
should set a sculptured porpoise gills a snort
and vibrant tail within the temple gate
first time he kissed me he but only kissed
the fingers of this hand wherewith i write
and ever since it grew more clean and white
slow to world greetings quick with its oh list
when the angels speak a ring of amethyst
i could not wear here plainer to my sight
than that first kiss the second passed in height
the first and sought the forehead and half missed
half falling on the hair o beyond meed
that was the chrism of love which love's own crown
with sanctifying sweetness did precede
the third upon my lips was folded down
in perfect purple state since when indeed
i have been proud and said my love my own
because thou hast the power and own'st the grace
to look through and behind this mask of me
against which years have beat thus blanchingly
with their rains and behold my soul's true face
the dim and weary witness of life's race
because thou hast the faith and love to see
through that same soul's distracting lethargy
the patient angel waiting for a place
in the new heavens  because nor sin nor woe
nor god's infliction nor death's neighbourhood
nor all which others viewing turn to go
nor all which makes me tired of all self viewed
nothing repels thee    dearest teach me so
to pour out gratitude as thou dost good
oh yes they love through all this world of ours
i will not gainsay love called love forsooth
i have heard love talked in my early youth
and since not so long back but that the flowers
then gathered smell still mussulmans and giaours
throw kerchiefs at a smile and have no ruth
for any weeping polypheme's white tooth
slips on the nut if after frequent showers
the shell is over smooth  and not so much
will turn the thing called love aside to hate
or else to oblivion but thou art not such
a lover my belovegraved thou canst wait
through sorrow and sickness to bring souls to touch
and think it soon when others cry too late
i thank all who have loved me in their hearts
with thanks and love from mine deep thanks to all
who paused a little near the prison wall
to hear my music in its louder parts
ere they went onward each one to the mart's
or temple's occupation beyond call
but thou who in my voice's sink and fall
when the sob took it thy divinest art's
own instrument didst drop down at thy foot
to hearken what i said between my tears
instruct me how to thank thee oh to shoot
my soul's full meaning into future years
that they should lend it utterance and salute
love that endures from life that disappears
my future will not copy fair my past
i wrote that once and thinking at my side
my ministering life angel justified
the word by his appealing look upcast
to the white throne of god i turned at last
and there instead saw thee not unallied
to angels in thy soul  then i long tried
by natural ills received the comfort fast
while budding at thy sight my pilgrim's staff
gave out green leaves with morning dews impearled
i seek no copy now of life's first half
leave here the pages with long musing curled
and write me new my future's epigraph
new angel mine unhoped for in the world
how do i love thee let me count the ways
i love thee to the depth and breadth and height
my soul can reach when feeling out of sight
for the ends of being and ideal grace
i love thee to the level of everyday's
most quiet need by sun and candle light
i love thee freely as men strive for right
i love thee purely as they turn from praise
i love thee with the passion put to use
in my old griefs and with my childhood's faith
i love thee with a love i seemed to lose
with my lost saints  i love thee with the breath
smiles tears of all my life  and if god choose
i shall but love thee better after death
belovegraved thou hast brought me many flowers
plucked in the garden all the summer through
and winter and it seemed as if they grew
in this close room nor missed the sun and showers
so in the like name of that love of ours
take back these thoughts which here unfolded too
and which on warm and cold days i withdrew
from my heart's ground indeed those beds and bowers
be overgrown with bitter weeds and rue
and wait thy weeding yet here's eglantine
here's ivy  take them as i used to do
thy flowers and keep them where they shall not pine
instruct thine eyes to keep their colours true
and tell thy soul their roots are left in mine
i tell you hopeless grief is passionless
that only men incredulous of despair
half taught in anguish through the midnight air
beat upward to god's throne in loud access
of shrieking and reproach full desertness
in souls as countries lieth silent bare
under the blanching vertical eye glare
of the absolute heavens deep hearted man express
grief for thy dead in silence like to death
most like a monumental statue set
in everlasting watch and moveless woe
till itself crumble to the dust beneath
touch it the marble eyelids are not wet
if it could weep it could arise and go
experience like a pale musician holds
a dulcimer of patience in his hand
whence harmonies we cannot understand
of god will in his worlds the strain unfolds
in sad perplexed minors deathly colds
fall on us while we hear and countermand
our sanguine heart back from the fancyland
with nightingales in visionary wolds
we murmur 'where is any certain tune
or measured music in such notes as these'
but angels leaning from the golden seat
are not so minded their fine ear hath won
the issue of completed cadences
and smiling down the stars they whisper  sweet
wordsworth upon helvellyn let the cloud
ebb audibly along the mountain wind
then break against the rock and show behind
the lowland valleys floating up to crowd
the sense with beauty he with forehead bowed
and humble lidded eyes as one inclined
before the sovran thought of his own mind
and very meek with inspirations proud
takes here his rightful place as poet priest
by the high altar singing prayer and prayer
to the higher heavens a noble vision free
our haydon's hand has flung out from the mist
no portrait this with academic air
this is the poet and his poetry
thou large brained woman and large hearted man
self called george sand whose soul amid the lions
of thy tumultuous senses moans defiance
and answers roar for roar as spirits can
i would some mild miraculous thunder ran
above the applauded circus in appliance
of thine own nobler nature's strength and science
drawing two pinions white as wings of swan
from thy strong shoulders to amaze the place
with holier light that thou to woman's claim
and man's mightst join beside the angel's grace
of a pure genius sanctified from blame
till child and maiden pressed to thine embrace
to kiss upon thy lips a stainless fame
true genius but true woman dost deny
the woman's nature with a manly scorn
and break away the gauds and armlets worn
by weaker women in captivity
ah vain denial that revolted cry
is sobbed in by a woman's voice forlorn
thy woman's hair my sister all unshorn
floats back dishevelled strength in agony
disproving thy man's name and while before
the world thou burnest in a poet fire
we see thy woman heart beat evermore
through the large flame beat purer heart and higher
till god unsex thee on the heavenly shore
where unincarnate spirits purely aspire
what most men hunger for yet none achieves
save him who greatly cares not to be great
who knows the loom of time spins not more state
than that small filament a spider weaves
since single barley straws make piled up sheaves
and atoms diminute the gross earth's weight
nor comes from sirius earthward rarer freight
than this small taper beam my page receives
no greater is the desert than one sand
the mountain than one dust speck at its base
the ocean than one rain drop on my hand
and shakespeare's self there in the foremost place
hath but in ampler measure at command
that thought which shines from rustic hodge's face
the sonnet is a diamond flashing round
from every facet true rare coloured lights
a gem of thought carved in poetic nights
to grace the brow of art by fancy crowned
a miniature of soul wherein are found
marvels of beauty and resplendent sights
a drop of blood with which a lover writes
his heart's sad epitaph in its own bound
a pearl gained from dark waters when the deep
rocked in its frenzied passion the last note
heard from a heaven saluting skylark's throat
a cascade small flung in a canyon steep
with crystal music at this shrine of song
high priests of poesy have worshipped long
there is a playwright older than the years
who maketh all men actors in his play
and though they know not what they do or say
the purpose of the plot in all appears
each in his turn beset with inborn fears
enters unseen youth's comedy so gay
laughs through the hours that glide too soon away
beneath the clouds of soul consuming tears
then manhood's tragedy with perils fraught
pursues its fickle fortunes to the end
when fate the villain of the piece doth send
by whom the last exciting scene is wrought
a timely stab from death's sure falling knife
brings down the curtain o'er the play of life
vine tendrils drooping in the midday sun
take me to greece ere sappho sang those lays
whose echoes falling down this length of days
trance us with beauty sweet and halcyon
satyrs green garlanded skip madly on
through woody wilds loud shouts of ribald praise
mingle with merry laughter and amaze
the peaceful shepherds who affrighted run
fair dryads swell the riot filling song
from every tree trunk and from each pure spring
sweet naiad voices rise with silvery ring
to welcome him who leads the dancing throng
old bacchus reeling 'neath the weight of wine
chanting a stave half drunken half divine
time weighs the destinies that men befall
bestows new laurels turns the green to sere
too oft no honors soothe the poet here
but when his shade has passed into the hall
of death we hearfame's trumpet sound through all
the avenues of this terrestrial sphere—
a blare that stirs no more the withered ear
but makes men pause to list the lofty call
to pay full homage to a slighted name
and genius long o'erlooked with fire acclaim
thus melancholy taciturn forlorn
poe went his way through thorns and rocks and sand
lo fortune gave him then her empty hand
but for him dead she pours her amplest horn
ensigns of empires flaunt thy flanking wall
grim ancient warders guard thy storied gate
loud babeled centuries at thy bastions wait
on spanish french and english seneschal
rich yellow folds of castile's haughty state
fair fleur de lys from proud parisian hall
st george's cross triumphant o'er them all
recall long years of fierce and bloody hate
but now the star eyed daisy lifts its form
from crevice chink and crumbling parapet
without one stain of battle's crimson storm
on snowy leaf with golden petal set
bright banneret which nature kindly rears
to deck with light the mould of bitter years
the nuptial knot at last is firmly tied
a hundred bells ring out a merry chime
a hundred wires proclaim to every clime—
manhattan takes fair brooklyn for his bride
in strength and beauty growing side by side
cities betrothed you waited vigorous prime
like steadfast lovers in the olden time
we wish you joy no longer twain but one
forever bound in links of triple steel
you need no marriage ritual to rehearse
which venice chanted to bright adria won
no golden ring the service now is real—
each other take for better or for worse
again i see him on the sunlit lawn
as in the may day of that final year
with brow as radiant as the early dawn
and eye transparent as the heavens clear
with cloak o'er shoulder thrown in careless grace
he stands enframed in budding flowers and trees
a genial orpheus with olympian face
forever fanned by pure arcadian breeze
ah more to me than prospero's magic isle
the paths and greensward where the poet dreamed
the opening blossoms wooed his kindly smile
the expectant flowers with richer colors gleamedmy
soul still clasps the warm and generous hand
which wields the sceptre of a kingless land
when
i do note the beauty of thine eyesand
think that they have long been sightless dust
when i observe the warrior's envied prize—
helmet and corselet—thick with yellow rust
when scutcheoned doors lie prone in castle halls
and turrets totter razed by ruthless time
when panelled brass from stately column falls
well graved with praises writ in lofty rhyme—
then i perceive how all things here decaythat
this wide world is but a shifting stagewhere
faith and love fierce pride and passion play
and narrow lines divide the fool and sage
where fame's brief candle flickers to its death
and beauty's reign is measured by a breath
imperial beauty born for ilium's blight
sweet winsome helen paragon of earthwould
that our flocks were still on ida's height
and princely halls unemptied of their mirth
alas proud troy is tottering to her fall
our promised joys are steeped in bitter pain
kinsmen and greek in deep derision call
and every eye speaks loathing and disdain
dear bribe of venus why were we beguiled
by cyprian words to walk in devious ways
and leave our names as synonymes reviled
forevermore through unforgiving days
o fruitless passion won at honor's cost
faith courage glory—all forever lost
with
measuring lines we reach from star to star
on pinion bold we seek creation's rim
the vast horizon mocks us from afar
with sphere on sphere beyond our vision dim
on weary wing our thought from voyage vainlike
that lone dove with neither leaf nor bud
returns to find the windowed ark again—
a floating refuge on a shoreless flood
o mystery vast which veils the sovereignbrow
o vergeless silence depths by light untrod
space without centre time eternal now
o star gemmed vesture seamless robe of god
what word doth this vast universe inthrall
bounded by nothing yet embracing all
one more fond kiss my romeo and away
the eastern hills are touched with rosy lightah
love with thee dun night is brightest dayand
brightest day when thou art gone is night
how blest the hours swift borne on starry wheels
how heavy waiting on the laggard sun
a weary void till day her eyelids seals
and heaven's high warders guard love's fortress wondear
romeo go yet i would have thee stay
o pilfering morn that robs the jewelled skies
purloining gems within thy mantle graytake all
but leave the one dear star i prize
alas that love from love should ever part
yon sunrise brings wan sunset to my heart
my cleopatra queen alas the day
thy lustrous eyes proclaimed such bitter doom
that shame and antony should live for aye
an epitaph on time's enduring tomb
soft coiling serpent thy enticing wiles
hold heroes captive in strong toils of gracefor
power is lost in passion as fond smiles
light up the matchless beauty of thy face
cold duty summons but enchantress fair
my courage melts beneath thy glowing eyesand
in thine arms i neither reck nor care
if roman honor lives or basely dies
let fame's rich pearl dissolve in nectar bright
farewell to valor—day is lost in night
miranda mine thy beauty is more rare
than may day flowers that deck the meadows green
thy lips are sweeter than the lily fairplucked
fresh at dawn from out the glittering sheen
the mantling color of thy cheek's bright hue
makes pale and shames the blood of damask rose
thine eye preserves the violet's pensive bluewhich
born of light with heaven's own color glowsthy
neck full sweet seems like a flowery lane
or garden pathway to thy gentle breast
where love that knows not passion's earthly stain
has dwelt alone and wished no other guest
here eden's flowers retain the morning dewand sweeter seem united all in you
a power is on the earth and in the air
from which the vital spirit shrinks afraid
and shelters him in nooks of deepest shade
from the hot steam and from the fiery glare
look forth upon the earth  her thousand plants
are smitten even the dark sun loving maize
faints in the field beneath the torrid blaze
the herd beside the shaded fountain pants
for life is driven from all the landscape brown
the bird has sought his tree the snake his den
the trout floats dead in the hot stream and men
drop by the sun stroke in the populous town
as if the day of fire had dawned and sent
its deadly breath into the firmament
aye thou art welcome heaven's delicious breath
when woods begin to wear the crimson leaf
and sons grow meek and the meek suns grow brief
and the year smiles as it draws near its death
wind of the sunny south oh still delay
in the gay woods and in the golden air
like to a good old age released from care
journeying in long serenity away
in such a bright late quiet would that i
might wear out life like thee 'mid bowers and brooks
and dearer yet the sunshine of kind looks
and music of kind voices ever nigh
and when my last sand twinkled in the glass
pass silently from men as thou dost pass
yet one smile more departing distant sun
one mellow smile through the soft vapory air
ere o'er the frozen earth the loud winds run
or snows are sifted o'er the meadows bare
one smile on the brown hills and naked trees
and the dark rocks whose summer wreaths are cast
and the blue gentian flower that in the breeze
nods lonely of her beauteous race the last
yet a few sunny days in which the bee
shall murmur by the hedge that skirts the way
the cricket chirp upon the russet lea
and man delight to linger in thy ray
yet one rich smile and we will try to bear
the piercing winter frost and winds and darkened air
thine eyes shall see the light of distant skies
yet cole thy heart shall bear to europe's strand
a living image of thy native land
such as on thy own glorious canvass lies
lone lakes  savannahs where the bison roves
rocks rich with summer garlands  solemn streams
skies where the desert eagle wheels and screams
spring bloom and autumn blaze of boundless groves
fair scenes shall greet thee where thou goest  fair
but different  every where the trace of men
paths homes graves ruins from the lowest glen
to where life shrinks from the fierce alpine air
gaze on them till the tears shall dim thy sight
but keep that earlier wilder image bright
they talk of short lived pleasure  be it so
pain dies as quickly stern hard featured pain
expires and lets her weary prisoner go
the fiercest agonies have shortest reign
and after dreams of horror comes again
the welcome morning with its rays of peace
oblivion softly wiping out the stain
makes the strong secret pangs of shame to cease
remorse is virtue's root its fair increase
are fruits of innocence and blessedness
thus joy o'erborne and bound doth still release
his young limbs from the chains that round him press
weep not that the world changes  did it keep
a stable changeless state 'twere cause indeed to weep
chains may subdue the feeble spirit but thee
tell of the iron heart they coiuld not tame
for thou wert of the mountains they proclaim
the everlasting creed of liberty
that creed is written on the untrampled snow
thundered by torrents which no power can hold
save that of god when he sends forth his cold
and breathed by winds that through the free heaven blow
thou while thy prison walls were dark around
didst meditate the lesson nature taught
and to thy brief captivity was brought
a vision of thy switzerland unbound
the bitter cup they mingled strengthened thee
for the great work to set thy country free
rude mass of earth from which with moileacuted hands
compulsive taught the brittle tubes i form
oft listless while my vagrant fancy warm
roves heedless of necessity's demands
amid parnassian bowers or wishful eyes
the flights of genius while sublime she soars
of moral truth in search or earth explores
or sails with science through the starry skies
yet must i own unsightly clod thy claim
to my attention for thou art my stead
when grows importunate the voice of need
and in the furnace thy last change i speed
ah then how eager do i urge the flame
how anxious watch thee mid that glowing fire
that threats my eyeballs with extinction dire
thou maid of gentle light thy straw wove vest
and russet cincture thy loose pale tinged hair
thy melancholy voice and languid air
as if shut up within that pensive breast
some never to be divulged grief was pressed
thy looks resigned that smiles of patience wear
while winter's blasts thy scattered tresses tear
thee autumn with divinest charms have blessed
let blooming spring with gaudy hopes delight
that dazzling summer shall of her be born
let summer blaze and winter's stormy train
breathe awful music in the ear of night
thee will i court sweet dying maid forlorn
and from thy glance will catch the inspired strain
new to the world when all was fairy ground
and shapes romantic swam before my sight
thy beauty caught my soul and tints as bright
and fair as fancy's dreams in thee i found
in cold experience when my hopes were drowned
and life's dark clouds over veiled in mists of night
the forms that wont to fill me with delight
thy view again dispelled the darkness round
shall i forget thee when the pallid cheek
the sighing voice wan look and plaintive air
no more the roseate hue of health bespeak
shall i neglect thee as no longer fair
no lovely maid if in my heart i seek
thy beauty deeply is engraven there
when first upon my childish eyelids broke
the morning sun over that rude flinted tower
bosomed in antique trees when first awoke
on each delighted sense the vernal flower
and birds began touched by the young spring to pour
their tremulous harmony when first the croak
of that old rookery and the woodman's stroke
speeded with purest joy mine infant hour
o dear departed spirits of holy men
by intellectual efforts purified
hovered ye round your earthly haunts again
to thirst of fame like yours my soul to guide
it is thus perchance that from life's earliest dawn
forwards by fairy lights my steps are drawn
the breath of heaven that over yonder trees
passing from thence a local tincture drew
here first upon my new born body blew
oh was there magic in the trembling breeze
that could with such delicious softness seize
each melting sense and wake to music new
and bear upon its wings a shadowy crew
that only fancy's gifted vision sees
still round the sacred mansion do ye dwell
ye lovely fairy tribes or are ye fled
o once again renew the entrancing spell
and over each raptured vein your pinions spread
bliss above earth were mine could i once more
those dear delusions of the soul restore
in eddying course when leaves began to fly
and autumn in her lap the store to strew
as 'mid wild scenes i chanced the muse to woo
through glens untrod and woods that frowned on high
two sleeping nymphs with wonder mute i spy
and lo she's gone  in robe of dark green hue
'twas echo from her sister silence flew
for quick the hunter's horn resounded to the sky
in shade affrighted silence melts away
not so her sister  hark for onward still
with far heard step she takes her lingering way
bounding from rock to rock and hill to hill
ah mark the merry maid in mockful play
with thousand mimic tones the laughing forest fill
when he returns and finds all sleeping here
some old some young some fair and some not fair
will he stoop down and whisper in each ear
awaken or for pity's sake forbear
saying how shall i meet their frozen stare
of wonder and their eyes so woebegone
how shall i comfort them in their despair
if they cry out 'too late let us sleep on'
perchance he will not wake us up but when
he sees us look so happy in our rest
will murmur poor dead women and dead men
dire was their doom and weary was their quest
wherefore awake them unto life again
let them sleep on untroubled  it is best
o rainbow rainbow on the livid height
softening its ashen outline into dream
dewy yet brilliant delicately bright
as pink wild roses' leaves why dost thou gleam
so beckoningly whom dost thou invite
still higher upward on the bitter quest
what dost thou promise to the weary sight
in that strange region whence thou issuest
speak'st thou of pensive runlets by whose side
our dear ones wander sweet and gentle eyed
in the soft dawn of a diviner day
art thou a promise come those hues and dyes
from heavenly meads near which thou dost arise
iris'd from quiet waters far away
the keeper of the concord light is dead
and gone its shining way to paradise
from that snug harbor of the soul he spies
a beacon glory round his memory shed
by waves that bring to hungry mortals bread
once cast upon the waters by the wise
kind hand that kept the light his startled eyes
gleam heavenly joy then fill with modest dread
and turn to greet the friends of other days
who lead him to his castles late of spain
within whose halls resound his unsung lays
the while a busy world beneath the wain
that plucks a star from concord's peaceful ways
in reverence pauses at a new made fane
when avon's bard his sweetest music scored
a woman's vision with the numbers blent
each to the other equal beauty lent
as weaving fancy robed the form adored
o poet didst thou see upon the board
eye filling rosalind whose playful bent
suffused thy lines juliet all passion spent
viola's sweet self and imogen's restored
'twas thine to give the music mated lines
but heaven alone empowers the counterpart
to walk in splendor where such genius shines
thrice happy we blest heirs of dual art
to own as mother tongue will shakespeare's writ
to live when kindling neilson voices it
small was thy share of all this world's delight
and scant thy poet's crown of flowers of praise
yet ever catches quaint of quaint old days
thou sang'st and singing kept thy spirit bright
even as to lips the winds of winter bite
some outcast wanderer sets his flute and plays
till at his feet blossom the icy ways
and from the snowdrift's bitter wasting white
he hears the uprising carol of the lark
soaring from clover seas with summer ripe
while freeze upon his cheek glad foolish tears
ah let us hope that somewhere in thy dark
herrick's full note and suckling's pleasant pipe
are sounding still their solace in thine ears
a thousand fans are fretting the hot air
soft swells the music of the interlude
above the murmurous hum of talk subdued
but from the noise withdrawn and from the glare
deep in the shadowy box your coilèd hair
gleams golden bright with diamonds bedewed
your head is bent i know your dark eyes brood
on the poor sheet of paper you hold there
that quotes my verses and i see no more
that bald head plutus by your side the seas
sound in my ears i hear the rustling pines
catch the low lisp of billows on the shore
where once i lay in knickerbockered ease
and read to you those then unprinted lines
as to a bird's song she were listening
her beautiful head is ever sidewise bent
her questioning eyes lift up their depths intent—
she who will never hear the wild birds sing
my words within her ears' cold chambers ring
faint with the city's murmurous sub tones blent
though with such sounds as suppliants may have sent             to high throned goddesses my speech takes wing
not for the side poised head's appealing grace
i gaze nor hair where fire in shadow lies—
for her this world's unhallowed noises base
melt into silence not our groans our cries
our curses reach that high removèd place
where dwells her spirit innocently wise
there is an  hour when first the westering sun
takes on  some forecast faint of future red
when from  the wings of weariness is shed
a  spell upon us toilers every one
the day's  work lags a little well nigh done
far dusky lofts  through all the close air spread
a smell of  eastern bales the old clerk's head
nods by  my side heavy with dreams begun
in dear dead  days wherein his heart is tombed
but i  my way to italy have found
or wander  where high stars gleam coldly through
the alpine  skies or in some nest perfumed
with soft parisian luxury set round
held out my arms  and cry at last to you
although  a curtain of the salt sea mist
may   fall  between the actor and our eyes—
although   he  change for dear and softer skies
these that   the  sun has yet but coyly kissed—
although the   voice  to which we loved to list
fail   ere  the thunder of our plaudits dies—
although   he  parts from us in gracious wise
with grateful memory left his eulogist—
his best is with us still
his perfect art
has held   us  'twixt a heart throb and a tear—
cheating our souls to passionate belief
and in   his  greatness we have now some part—
we   have  been courtiers of the crownless lear
and partners in othello's mighty grief
as to   the  drunkard who at morn doth wake
are   the  clear waters of the virgin spring
wherewith he   bathes  his eyes that burn and sting
and his intolerable thirst doth slake
so is the   thought  of thee to me who break
one sober moment sick and shuddering
from  all my life's unworthiness to fling
me at   thy  memory's feet and for love's sake
pray that   thy  peace may enter in my soul
love thou   hast  heart my veins more calmly flow—
the   madness  of the night is passed away—
fire   of   false  eyes thirst of the cursèd bowl—
i   drink  deep of thy purity and lo
thou hast   given me  new heart to meet the day
speak it no more  no more with words profane
what only for the language of the eye
is fit  what only can be told thereby
the heart has tones which words cannot contain
and feelings which to speak is to restrain
like scent with scent commixed invisibly
or rays of neighbour planets in the sky
inter confused or as in some deep strain
of music heavenly passion is combined
with thought and tone with tone in harmony
thus be the meeting of our hearts dear love
the pure communion of mind with mind
above poor symbols of this earth  above
all that can baulk or cramp  can change or die
fourteen a sonneteer thy praises sings
what magic myst'ries in that number lie
your hen hath fourteen eggs beneath her wings
that fourteen chickens to the roost may fly
fourteen full pounds the jockey's stone must be
his age fourteen  a horse's prime is past
fourteen long hours too oft the bard must fast
fourteen bright bumpers  bliss he ne'er must see
before fourteen a dozen yields the strife
before fourteen  e'en thirteen's strength is vain
fourteen good years  a woman gives us life
fourteen good men  we lose that life again
what lucubrations can be more upon it
fourteen good measur'd verses make a sonnet
a wealth of silence that is all the air
lacks life and holds no hint of tender spring
of flowers wholesome blowing birds a wing
of any creature much alive and fair
perhaps you guess a murmur here and there
among the tomes each book a gossip thing
and each in her own tongue—yet slumbering
seems more the bookish fashion everywhere
and yet could but the souls take flesh again
that wrought these words their hearts all passion swirled
what companies would flock and fill the stage
resuming now their old imperious reign
knight noble lady priest the saint and sage
the valor bloom and wisdom of a world
he's not alonean artist weak and white
o'erbending scented paper toying there
with languid fancies fashioned deft and fair
mere sops to time between the day and night
he is a poor torn soul who sees aright
how far he fails of living out the rare
night visions god vouchsafes along the air
until the pain burns hot beyond his might
the heart beat of the universal will
he hears and spite of blindness and disproof
can sense amidst the jar a singing fine
grief smitten that his lyre should lack the skill
to speak it plain he plays in paths aloof
and knows the trend is starward life divine
i saw a picture once by angelo—
unfinished said the critic done in youth—
and that was all no thought of praise forsooth
he was informed and doubtless it was so
and yet i let an hour of dreaming go
the way of all time touched to tears and ruth
passion and joy the prick of conscience's tooth
before that careworn christ's divine soft glow
the painter's yearning with an unsure hand
had moved me more than might his master days
he seemed to speak like one whose mecca land
is first beheld tho' faint and far the ways
who may not then his shaken voice command
yet trembles forth a word of prayer and praise
if so there were a spirit poised in peace
above all wind gusts in the heavens high
and he might mark us mortals laugh or cry
according as the glooméd clouds increase
or suns beguile them into golden fleece
methinks he would be like to smile to sigh
so placid he so far within the sky
and knowing god's great love can never cease
that we the puny yet the prideful race
must change as skies change be like babes that fret
whenso their yearning mother moves her breast
to ease her mothering or turns her face
aside a moment reaching out to get
some wrapping soft to lull their limbs to rest
oh for a breath of spicy woodland air
the healing balsam of the odorous pine
to thrill my nerveless pulse like beaded wine
oh for some sylvan hebe to prepare
for me the nectared cups of mosses rare
till quickened sense shall catch the merry shine
of hidden wood nymph's eyes that flash on mine
'tween waving tresses of the maidenhair
oh for a day of freedom in the wood
to wander with head bared with feet untamed
and cheek incarnadined with bounding blood
of nature's code and impulse unashamed
oh for a day so breezy free and wild
the dryads haste to claim me as their child
we oft are sorrowful yet have no word
to tell why gloom has settled on the day
like clouds that blot the azure field with gray
we know not why the singing of a bird
touches the soul to pain as if we heard
within the voice another music say
things not translated in our human way
we pierce ourselves with blame yet have not erred
exiles we are and when the outreaching heart
is quickened to sense its native atmosphere—
when through the fair world's form the spirit part
reveals itself an instant passing dear—
when in a flower's sweet face new meanings dart
we mourn shut out for that which is so near
eternal spirit of the chainless mind
brightest in dungeons liberty thou art
for there thy habitation is the heart
the heart which love of thee alone can bind
and when thy sons to fetters are consigned
to fetters and the damp vault's dayless gloom
their country conquers with their martyrdom
and freedom's fame finds wings on every wind
chillon thy prison is a holy place
and thy sad floor an altar for 'twas trod
until his very steps have left a trace
worn as if thy cold pavement were a sod
by bonnivard may none those marks efface
for they appeal from tyranny to god
where lies the land to which thy soul would go
beyond the wearied wold the songless dell
the purple grape and golden asphodel
beyond the zone where streams baptismal flow
where lies the land of which thy soul would know
there where the unvexed senses darkling dwell
where never haunting hurrying footfall fell
where toil is not nor builded hope laid low
rest rest to thy hushed realm how one by one
old earth's tired ages steal away and weep
forgotten or unknown long duty done
ah god when death in seeming peace shall steep
life's loud turmoil and time his race hath run
shall heart of man at length find rest and sleep
vocal yet voiceless lingering lambent white
with the wide wings of evening on the fell
the tranquil vale the enchanted citadel
another day swoons to another night
speak low from bare blencathra's purple height
the sound o' the ghyll falls furled and loath to go
a continent of cloud its plaited snow
wears far away athwart a lake of light
is it the craft of hell that while we lie
enshaded lulled beneath heaven's breezeless sky
the garrulous clangours and assoileumld shows
of london's burrowing mazes haunt us yet
city forgive me mother of joys and woes
thy shadow is here and lo our eyes are wet
i walk'd at sunset by the lonely waves
when autumn stood about me gold and brown
i watch'd the great red sun in clouds go down
an orient king that 'mid his bronzeumld slaves
dies leaning on his sceptre with his crown
a hollow moaning from innumerous caves
in green and glassy darkness sunk below
told of some grand and ancient deed of woe
of murdered kings that sleep in weltering graves
still thro' the sunshine wavering to and fro
with sails all set the little vessels glide
mild is the eve and mild the ebbing tide
and yet that hollow moaning will not go
nor the old fears that with the sea abide
me let the world disparage and despise
as one unfettered with its gilded chains
as one untempted by its sordid gains
its pleasant vice its profitable lies
let justice blind and halt and maimed chastise
the rebel spirit surging in my veins
let the law deal me penalties and pains
and make me hideous in my neighbours' eyes
but let me fall not in mine own esteem
by poor deceit or selfish greed debased
let me be clean from secret stain and shame
know myself true though false as hell i seem
know myself worthy howsoe'er disgraced
know myself right though every tongue should blame
alone  alone  no beacon far or near
no chart no compass and no anchor stay
like melting fog the mirage melts away
in all surrounding darkness void and clear
drifting i spread vain hands and vainly peer
and vainly call for pilot    weep and pray
beyond these limits not the faintest ray
shows distant coast whereto the lost may steer
o what is life if we must hold it thus
as wind blown sparks hold momentary fire
what are these gifts without the larger boon
o what is art or wealth or fame to us
who scarce have time to know what we desire
o what is love if we must part so soon
and is the great cause lost beyond recall
have all the hopes of ages come to naught
is life no more with noble meaning fraught
is life but death and love its funeral pall
maybe  and still on bended knees i fall
filled with a faith no preacher ever taught
o god    my god    by no false prophet wrought
i believe still in despite of it all
let go the myths and creeds of groping men
this clay knows naught    the potter understands
i own that power divine beyond my ken
and still can leave me in his shaping hands
but o my god that madest me to feel
forgive the anguish of the turning wheel
o crimson hearted flower producing june
dear month of love and laughter and light song
wherein our mother brings her choral throng
to hymn the hymns that sweetest are in tune
wherein all gaily goes gave soul of wrong
that takes to bed quite blinded by the light
of that sweet sober gentle queen of night
that rules the tides of earth and men  the moon
i love you for it was beneath your skies
i first looked love into her starry eyes
i love you for beneath your dome of blue
i heard her answer  and i love you too
i hate you  'mid your flowers it was my lot
to hear those same lips say  i love you not
wisdom immortal from immortal jove
shadows more beauty with her virgin brows
than is between the virgin breasts of love
who makes at will and breaks her random vows
and hath a name all earthly names above
the noblest are her offspring she controls
the time and seasons  yea all things that are
the heads and hands of men their hearts and souls
and all that moves upon our mother star
and all that pauses 'twixt the peaceful poles
nor is she dark and distant coy and cold
but all in all to all who seek her shrine
in utter truth like to that king of old
who wooed and won  yet by no right divine
anticipation is the oil that feeds
the flame of life it is the siren fair
that sings at twilight in the hollow reeds
and drowns the moaning discord of despair
nay now in darkest night it comes to me
it dulls the edge of every present care
blots from the tablets of the memory
what hath been ill or is inscribing there
in golden letters that which yet may be
of earth's good things my individual share
and should the days be drearier in age
and disappointment part of mine estate
with fortune i shall not a warfare wage
but sing my song as now  as now anticipate
when midst the summer roses the warm bees
are swarming in the sun and thou  so full
of innocent glee  dost with thy white hands pull
pink scented apples from the garden trees
to fling at me i catch them on my knees
like those who gathered manna and i cull
some hasty buds to pelt thee  white as wool
lilies or yellow jonquils or heartsease
then i can speak my love even though thy smiles
gush out among thy blushes like a flock
of bright birds from rose bowers but when thou'rt gone
i have no speech  no magic that beguiles
the stream of utterance from the hardened rock
the dial cannot speak without the sun
there dwells a spirit in the budding year
as motherhood doth beautify the face
that even lends these barren glebes a grace
and fills grey hours with beauty that were drear
and bleak when the loud storming march was here
a glamour that the thrilled heart dimly traces
in swelling boughs and soft wet windy spaces
and sunlands where the chattering birds make cheer
i thread the uplands where the wind's footfalls
stir leaves in gusty hollows autumn's urns
seaward the river's shining breast expands
high in the windy pines a lone crow calls
and far below some patient ploughman turns
his great black furrow over steaming lands
already winter in his sombre round
before his time hath touched these hills austere
with lonely flame last night without a sound
the ghostly frost walked out by wood and mere
and now the sumach curls his frond of fire
the aspen tree reluctant drops his gold
and down the gullies the north's wild vibrant lyre
rouses the bitter armies of the cold
o'er this short afternoon the night draws down
with ominous chill across these regions bleak
wind beaten gold the sunset fades around
the purple loneliness of crag and peak
leaving the world an iron house wherein
nor love nor life nor hope hath ever been
this summer day is all one palace rare
builded by architects of life unseen
in elfin hours the sun and moon between
up out of quarries of the sea and air
and earth's fine essences aladdin's were
but tinsel sheen beside this gloried dream
high sunny windowed walled by wood and stream
and high dome roofed blue burnished beyond compare
here reigns a king the happiest known on earth
that blithesome monarch mortals call the wind
who roves his galleries wide in vagrant mirth
his courtier clouds obedient to his mind
or when he sleeps his sentinal stars are still
with ethiop guards o'ertopping some grave hill
home of the pure in heart and tranquil mind
temple of love's white silence holy night
greater than splendid thought or iron might
thy lofty peace unswept by any wind
of human sorrow leaves all care behind
uplifted to the zenith of thy height
my world worn spirit drinks thy calm delight
and chrysalis like lets slip its earthly rind
the blinded feuds base passions and fierce guilt
vain pride and falseness that enslaved the day
here dwindle and fade with all that mocks and mars
where wisdom awed walks hushed with lips that pray
'neath this high minster dim invisible built
vast walled with deeps of space and roofed with stars
not unto endless dark do we go down
though all the wisdom of wide earth said yea
yet my fond heart would throb eternal nay
night prophet of morning wears her starry crown
and jewels with hope her murkiest shades that frown
death's doubt is kernelled in each prayer we pray
eternity but night in some vast day
of god's far off red flame of love's renown
not unto endless dark we may not know
the distant deeps to which our hopings go
the tidal shores where ebbs our fleeting breath
but over ill and dread and doubt's fell dart
sweet hope eternal holds the human heart
and love laughs down the desolate dusks of death
we are what nature made us soon or late
life's art that fadeth passeth slow away
with iron eatings of our sordid day
leaving behind those influences innate
immutable divine as round some great
rude craggy isle the loud surf's ravening fray
shatters all life in spume of thundered spray
leaving huge cliffs scarred grim in naked state
so life and all its idols hath its hour
its fleet ephemeral dream its passing show
its pomp of fevered hopes that come and go
then stripped of vanity and folly's power
like some wide water bared to moon and star
we know ourselves in truth for what we are
for twenty years did nature wait without
besetting that storm beaten tenement
claiming her debt from door to door she went
rude battering with all her hostile rout
and we who helpless watching stood about
while frail walls tottered and light bolts were bent
thinking each day to see some fatal rent
did marvel much that house should be so stout
but love was there the lord of life and death
and held the importunate enemy at bay
yet when his work was done all peacefully
as dawn grows day life yielded up his breath
and led by love immortal went away
surrendering to a vanquished enemy
chained to the oar and hopeless of reprieve
from year to year to one dull task confined
a task that needs no effort of the mind
a task mere honest dulness might achieve
tell me sincerely though too proud to grieve
or murmur at thy destinies unkind
dost thou not feel at least the chains that bind
thy spirit down to toils it must not leave
to have decked the shrine of ceres with the flowers
that science gave to thy collecting hand
to have served by useful arts thy native land
these were thy hopes on these were bent thy powers
these hopes foregone repress thy vain desires
curb thy aspiring soul and quench her useless fires
i had a dream all beautifully sad
my life's sole solace had gone up on high
and i was left on earth alone to die
musing in resignation almost glad
i wept my loss when lo in beauty clad
i saw my loved one to my couch draw nigh
for she had descended from the sky
if to my grief she might some respite add
sweet was the thought that love could bring her down
but i was troubled as the mother when
her suff'ring infant wakes and moans again
o linger not  resume your heavenly crown
i said and as soft notes of music fail
she smiling melted in the moonbeams pale
to look upon the face of a dead friend
is hard but 'tis not more than we can bear
if haply we can see peace written there
peace after pain and welcome so the end
whate'er the past whatever death may send
yea and that face a gracious smile may wear
if love till death was perfect sweet and fair
but there is woe from which may god defend
to look upon our friendship lying dead
while we live on and eat and drink and sleep
mere bodies from which all the soul has fled
and that dead thing year after year to keep
locked in cold silence in its dreamless bed
there must be hell while there is such a deep
the day has past i never may return
twelve circling years have run since first i came
and kindled the pure truth of friendship's flame
alone remain these ashes in the urn—
vainly for light the taper may i turn—
thy hand is closed as for these years the same
and for the substance nought is but the name
no more hope no more a ray to burn
but once more in the pauses of thy joy
remember him who sought thee in his youth
and with the old reliance of the boy
asked for thy treasures in the guise of truth
the air is thick with sighs—the shaded sun
shows on the hillside that the day is done
hearts of eternity hearts of the deep
proclaim from land to sea your mighty fate
how that for you no living comes too late
how ye cannot in theban labyrinth creep
how ye great harvests from small surface reap
shout excellent band in grand primeval strain
like midnight winds that foam along the main
and do all things rather than pause to weep
a human heart knows nought of littleness
suspects no man compares with no one's ways
hath in one hour most glorious length of days
a recompense a joy a loveliness
like eaglet keen shoots into azure far
and always dwelling nigh is the remotest star
take of the maiden's and the mother's sigh
of childhood's dream and hope that age doth bless
of roses and the south wind's tenderness
of fir tree's shadow tint of sunset sky
of moon on meadow where the stream runs by
of lover's kiss his diffident caress
of blue eyes' yellow brown eyes' darker tress
of echoes from the morning bird on high
of passion of all pulses of the spring
of prayer from every death bed of the fall
of joy and woe that sleep and waking bring
of tremor of each blood beat great and small
now pour into the empty soul each thing
and let his finger touch that moveth all
the skillful listener methinks may hear
the grass blades clash in suny field together
the roses kissing and the lily whether
it laugh or sigh low in the summer's ear
the jewel dew bells of the mead ring clear
when morning's nearing in the sweet june weather
the flocked hours winging feather unto feather
the last leaf wail at waning of the year
methinks from these we catch a passing song
the best of verities perhaps but seem
hearing forsooth shy nature on her round
when least she imagines it birds wood and stream
not only but her silences profound
surprised by softer footfall of our dream
stilton thou shouldst be living at this hour
and so thou art  nor losest grace thereby
england has need of thee and so have i
she is a fen  far as the eye can scour
league after grassy league from lincoln tower
to stilton in the fields she is a fen
yet this high cheese by choice of fenland men
like a tall green volcano rose in power
plain living and long drinking are no more
and pure religion reading household words
and sturdy manhood sitting still all day
shrink like this cheese that crumbles to its core
while my digestion like the house of lords
the heaviest burdens on herself doth lay
friend of my chamber  o thou spiral shell
that murmurest of the ever murmuring sea
repeating with eternal constancy
whatever memories the wave can tell
whatever harmonies may rise and swell
whatever sadness in the deep may be
they are the ocean's and desired of thee
thou treasurest what thou dost love so well
so all my heart is one voluted fold
shielding one face and evermore it seems
upon the threshold of the prying day
hid in the tangle of reluctant dreams
and in the noontide and the evening grey
its light illumines secrecies untold
i am not here alone a hidden throng
is round me in the vesper of the sky
dead babylon and nineveh are nigh
rome antioch the slave who felt the thong
the lord that slew him when the day was long
and the soul heavy with satiety
and some are near who saw the christ go by
while pilate shut aloof at gaze with wrong
and what are they these ministers surround
the cliff the sand the island at my feet
reef scattered far below all human ken
lo god hath made a mighty angel beat
his wings a benediction in their sound
above the roof of the most forlorn of men
wordsworth i love his books are like the fields
not filled with flowers but works of human kind
the pleasant weed a fragrant pleasure yields
the briar and broomwood shaken by the wind
the thorn and bramble o'er the water shoot
a finer flower than gardens e'er gave birth
the aged huntsman grubbing up the root
i love them all as tenants of the earth
where genius is there often die the seeds
what critics throw away i love the more
i love to stoop and look among the weeds
to find a flower i never knew before
wordsworth go on  a greater poet be
merit will live though parties disagree
when shall i see the white thorn leaves agen
and yellowhammers gath'ring the dry bents
by the dyke side on stilly moor or fen
feathered wi love and natures good intents
rude is the nest this architect invents
rural the place wi cart ruts by dyke side
dead grass horse hair and downy headed bents
tied to dead thistles she doth well provide
close to a hill o' ants where cowslips bloom
and shed o'er meadows far their sweet perfume
in early spring when winds blow chilly cold
the yellowhammer trailing grass will come
to fix a place and choose an early home
with yellow breast and head of solid gold
elia thy reveries and visioned themes
to care's lorn heart a luscious pleasure prove
wild as the mystery of delightful dreams
soft as the anguish of remembered love
like records of past days their memory dances
mid the cool feelings manhood's reason brings
as the unearthly visions of romances
peopled with sweet and uncreated things
and yet thy themes thy gentle worth enhances
then wake again thy wild harp's tenderest strings
sing on sweet bard let fairy loves again
smile in thy dreams with angel ecstasies
bright over our souls will break the heavenly strain
through the dull gloom of earth's realities
what mellow radiance wraps the slumbering world
soothing its harshness with benignant hand
against a lustrous amber background stand
black bordered leaves and branches loosely swirled
in flushed or citrine tinted heaps close curled
the apples rest the orange pumpkins yield
to cumbrous sleep and on the spreading field
the tasselled tents of ripened corn are furled
elusive spirits flutter everywhere
'mid moist brown leaves and all the vaporous air
is filled with whispering in an unknown tongue
yet not unknown thy praise is every sound
the teeming earth thine altar is fruit crowned
the moon a golden censer near it swung
the darkness throbbed that night with the great heat
and my heart throbbed at thought of what should be
the house was dumb the lock slid silently
i only heard the night's hot pulses beat
around me as i sped with quiet feet
down the dark corridors and once the sea
moaned in its slumber and i stayed but she
came forth to meet me lily white and sweet
was there a man's soul ever worth her kiss
silent and still i stood and she drew near
and her lips mixed with mine and her sweet breath
fanned my hot face and afterward i wis
what the sea said to us i did not hear
but now i know it spake of doom and death
o death death death thou art the lord of all
and at thy temple where for thee are shed
man's blood and tears gods kings and temples fall
thy reign o lord is immemorial
ever thou waxest stronger and more dread
more populous grows thy kingdom of the dead
and joy and love and hope thou hast in thrall
we follow vain desires and idle things
we vex our souls with hollow hopes and fears
we dread the future and regret the past
thou comest o almighty king of kings
and stillest all the tumult of the years
and tak'st each babbler to thy breast at last
whence comest thou shady lane and why and how
thou where with idle heart ten years ago
i wandered and with childhood's paces slow
so long unthought of and remembered now
again in vision clear thy pathwayed side
i tread and view thy orchard plots again
with yellow fruitage hung  and glimmering grain
standing or shocked through the thick hedge espied
this hot still noon of august brings the sight
this quelling silence as of eve or night
wherein earth feeling as a mother will
after her travail's latest bitterest throes
looks up so seemeth it one half repose
one half in effort straining suffering still
if it is thou whose casual hand withdraws
what it at first as casually did make
say what amount of ages it will take
with tardy rare concurrences of laws
and subtle multiplicities of cause
the thing they once had made us to remake
may hopes dead slumbering dare to reawake
even after utmost interval of pause
what revolutions must have passed before
the great celestial cycles shall restore
the starry sign whose present hour is gone
what worse than dubious chances interpose
with cloud and sunny gleam to recompose
the skiey picture we had gazed upon
that children in their loveliness should die
before the dawning beauty which we know
cannot remain has yet begun to go
that when a certain period has passed by
people of genius and of faculty
leaving behind them some result to show
having performed some function should forgo
the task which younger hands can better ply
appears entirely natural
but that one
whose perfectness did not at all consist
in things towards forming which time can have done
anything  whose sole office was to exist
should suddenly dissolve and cease to be
is the extreme of all perplexity
yes i have lied and so must walk my way
bearing the liar's curse upon my head
letting my weak and sickly heart be fed
on food which does the present craving stay
but may be clean denied me e'en today
and though 'twere certain yet were ought but bread
letting  for so they say it seems i said
and i am all too weak to disobey
therefore for me sweet nature's scenes reveal not
their charm sweet music greets me and i feel not
sweet eyes pass off me uninspired yea more
the golden tide of opportunity
flows wafting in friendships and better  i
unseeing listless pace along the shore
here am i yet another twelvemonth spent
one third departed of the mortal span
carrying on the child into the man
nothing into reality sails rent
and rudder broken  reason impotent
affections all unfixed so forth i fare
on the mid seas unheedingly so dare
to do and to be done by well content
so was it from the first so is it yet
yea the first kiss that by these lips was set
on any human lips methinks was sin
sin cowardice and falsehood for the will
into a deed e'en then advanced wherein
god unidentified was thought of still
that children in their loveliness should die
before the dawning beauty which we know
cannot remain has yet begun to go
that when a certain period has passed by
people of genius and of faculty
leaving behind them some result to show
having performed some function should forego
a task which younger hands can better ply
appears entirely natural but that one
whose perfectness did not at all consist
in things towards forming which time could have done
anything  whose sole office was to exist
should suddenly dissolve and cease to be
calls up the hardest questions
that there are better things within the womb
of nature than to our unworthy view
she grants for a possession may be true
the cycle of the birthplace and the tomb
fulfils at least the order and the doom
of her that has not ordinance to do
more than to withdraw and to renew
to show one moment and the next resume
the law that we return from whence we came
may for the flowers beasts and most men remain
if for ourselves we ask not nor complain
but for a being that demands the name
we highest deem  a person and a soul
it troubles us if this should be the whole
to see the rich autumnal tints depart
and view the fading of the roseate glow
that veils some alpine altitude of snow
to hear some mighty masterpiece of art
lost or destroyed may to the adult heart
impatient of the transitory show
of lovelinesses that but come and go
a positive strange thankfulness impart
when human pure perfections disappear
not at the first but at some later day
the buoyancy of such reaction may
with strong assurance conquer blank dismay
but if as not by what the soul desired
swayed in the judgment wisest men have thought
and furnishing the evidence it sought
man's heart hath ever fervently required
and story for that reason deemed inspired
to every clime in every age hath taught
if in this human complex there be aught
not lost in death as not in birth acquired
o then though cold the lips that did convey
rich freights of meaning dead each living sphere
where thought abode and fancy loved to play
thou yet we think somewhere somehow still art
and satisfied with that the patient heart
the where and how doth not desire to hear
if it is thou whose casual hand withdraws
what it at first as casually did make
say what amount of ages it will take
with tardy rare concurrences of laws
and subtle multiplicities of cause
the thing they once had made us to remake
may hopes dead slumbering dare to reawake
e'en after utmost interval of pause
what revolutions must have passed before
the great celestial cycles shall restore
the starry sign whose present hour is gone
what worse than dubious chances interpose
with cloud and sunny gleam to recompose
the skiey picture we had gazed upon
but whether in the uncoloured light of truth
this inward strong assurance be indeed
more than the self willed arbitrary creed
manhood's inheritor to the dream of youth
whether to shut out fact because forsooth
to live were insupportable unfreed
be not or be the service of untruth
whether this vital confidence be more
than his who upon death's immediate brink
knowing perforce determines to ignore
or than the bird's that when the hunter comes
burying her eyesight can forget her fear
who about this shall tell us what to think
shall i decide it by a random shot
our happy hopes so happy and so good
are not mere idle motions of the blood
and when they seem most baseless most are not
a seed there must have been upon the spot
where the flowers grow without it ne'er they could
the confidence of growth least understood
of some deep intuition was begot
what if despair and hope alike be true
the heart 'tis manifest is free to do
whichever nature and itself suggest
and always 'tis a fact that we are here
and with being here doth palsy giving fear
whoe'er can ask or hope accord the best
penelope sat weaving all the day
her web and i weave mine of tender thought
and many a quaint device by me is wrought
of fancy's golden threads what will he say
when he shall come will he entreat and pray
to see the legend will his heart be taught
by it night comes and brings me naught
i must unweave ulysses is away
but when my hero shall at last have come
and his dear eyes have proved my colors true
i wonder will my stammering lips be dumb
my heart's great love unspoken then must you
dear woven thing help eyes and blushing cheek
to tell him all i feel but cannot speak
i woke and heard the thrushes sing at dawn—
a strangely blissful burst of melody
a chant of rare exultant certainty
fragrant as springtime breaths of wood and lawn
night's eastern curtains still were closely drawn
no roseate flush predicted pomps to be
or spoke of morning loveliness to me
but for those happy birds—the night was gone
darkling they sang nor guessed what care consumes
man's questioning spirit heedless of decay
they   sang of joy and dew embalmèd blooms
my doubts grew still   doubts seemed so poor while they
sweet   worshipers of light from leafy glooms
poured forth transporting prophecies of day
let me believe   you love or let me die
if on your   faith i may not rest secure
beyond all chance of peradvenure sure
trusting   your half avowals sweet and shy
as trusts   the lark the pallid dawn lit sky
then would   i rather in some grave obscure
repose forlorn than living on endure
a   question each dear transport to belie
it is a   pain to thirst and do without
a pain   to suffer what we deem unjust
to win a joy   and lay it in the dust
but there's   a fiercer pain—the pain of doubt
from other   griefs death sets the spirit free
doubt steals the light from immortality
as a   wan weaver in an attic dim
hopeless yet   patient so he may be fed
with scanty store of sorrow seasoned bread
heareth   a blithe bird carol over him
and sees   no longer walls and rafters grim
but rural   lanes where little feet are led
through   springing flowers fields with clover spread
clouds swan like   that o'er depths of azure swim—
so when upon our earth dulled ear new breaks
some fragment sappho of thy skyey song
a noble wonder in our souls awakes
the deathless beautiful draws strangely nigh
and we look up and marvel how so long
we were content to drudge for sordid joys that die
above texts from representative sonnets by american poets
keep thou amidst the fulness of thy days
some little space apart for thoughts of me
where all the best i have and am may be
familiar and essential to thy ways
upon the hours' swift argosies emblaze
the prayer that ever shall encompass thee
the hope the aim the spirit's sudden plea
at once thy inspiration and thy praise
for he who keeps within his heart a shrine
where tender dreams may gather makes defence
against encroaching tides that undermine
the soul's integrity and confidence
and i would have act in every act of thine
love's presence conscious to thy deeper sense
as far as sight could reach the wild peaks rose
tier after tier against the limpid blue
titanic forms that stormed the heavens anew
at every turn crowned with imperial snows
and then as day sank softly to its close
diaphanous ethereal they grew
mere wraiths of rainbow mist that from our view
dream laden lapsed to darkness and repose
and suddenly i found my vision blurred
and knew that deeper chord was touched again
which once in hungary when i had heard
a passionately wild appealing strain
of gypsy music left me strangely stirred
with incommunicable joy and pain
she sitteth in the sunshine old and grey
her faded kerchief crossed upon her breast
her withered form in sober colors dressed
her thoughts fixed ever on the far away
she scarcely sees the children at their play
but looks beyond them to the crimsoning west
and still beyond where everlasting rest
remains to close and crown her little day
but on her tranquil and unconscious face
in lines engraved by joy no less than tears
the story of her pilgrimage we trace
for youth quick flying left his dearer part
and all the fragrance of the vanished years
imperishable lies within her heart
all nature seems at work slugs leave their lair
the bees are stirring  birds are on the wing
and winter slumbering in the open air
wears on his smiling face a dream of spring
and i the while the sole unbusy thing
nor honey make nor pair nor build nor sing
yet well i ken the banks where amaranths blow
have traced the fount whence streams of nectar flow
bloom o ye amaranths bloom for whom ye may
for me ye bloom not glide rich streams away
with lips unbrightened wreathless brow i stroll
and would you learn the spells that drowse my soul
work without hope draws nectar in a sieve
and hope without an object cannot live
thou bleedest my poor heart and thy distress
reasoning i ponder with a scornful smile
and probe thy sore wound sternly though the while
swoln be mine eye and dim with heaviness
why didst thou listen to hope's whisper bland
or listening why forget the healing tale
when jealousy with feverous fancies pale
jarr'd thy fine fibres with a maniac's hand
faint was that hope and rayless  yet 'twas fair
and sooth'd with many a dream the hour of rest
thou should'st have lov'd it most when most opprest
and nurs'd it with an agony of care
even as a mother her sweet infant heir
that wan and sickly droops upon her breast
what was't awakened first the untried ear
of that sole man who was all human kind
was it the gladsome welcome of the wind
stirring the leaves that never yet were sere
the four mellifluous streams which flowed so near
their lulling murmurs all in one combined
the note of bird unnamed the startled hind
bursting the brake in wonder not in fear
of her new lord or did the holy ground
send forth mysterious melody to greet
the gracious pressure of immaculate feet
did viewless seraphs rustle all around
making sweet music out of air as sweet
or his own voice awake him with its sound
there is an awful quiet in the air
and the sad earth with moist imploring eye
looks wide and wakeful at the pondering sky
like patience slow subsiding to despair
but see the blue smoke as a voiceless prayer
sole witness of a secret sacrifice
unfolds its tardy wreaths and multiplies
its soft chameleon breathings in the rare
capacious ether  so it fades away
and nought is seen beneath the pendent blue
the undistinguishable waste of day
so have i dreamed  oh may the dream be true
that praying souls are purged from mortal hue
and grow as pure as he to whom they pray
the crackling embers on the hearth are dead
the indoor note of industry is still
the latch is fast upon the window sill
the small birds wait not for their daily bread
the voiceless flowers  how quietly they shed
their nightly odours  and the household rill
murmurs continuous dulcet sounds that fill
the vacant expectation and the dread
of listening night and haply now she sleeps
for all the garrulous noises of the air
are hush'd in peace the soft dew silent weeps
like hopeless lovers for a maid so fair
oh that i were the happy dream that creeps
to her soft heart to find my image there
let me not deem that i was made in vain
or that my being was an accident
which fate in working its sublime intent
not wished to be to hinder would not deign
each drop uncounted in a storm of rain
hath its own mission and is duly sent
to its own leaf or blade not idly spent
'mid myriad dimples on the shipless main
the very shadow of an insect's wing
for which the violet cared not while it stayed
yet felt the lighter for its vanishing
proved that the sun was shining by its shade
then  can a drop of the eternal spring
shadow of living lights in vain be made
the mellow year is hastening to its close
the little birds have almost sung their last
their small notes twitter in the dreary blast
that shrill piped harbinger of early snows
the patient beauty of the scentless rose
oft with the morn's hoar crystal quaintly glassed
hangs a pale mourner for the summer past
and makes a little summer where it grows
in the chill sunbeam of the faint brief day
the dusky waters shudder as they shine
the russet leaves obstruct the straggling way
of oozy brooks which no deep banks define
and the gaunt woods in ragged scant array
wrap their old limbs with sombre ivy twine
yes cross in rest the little snow white hands
do you not see the lips so faintly red
with love's last kiss their sweetness has not fled
though now you say her sinless spirit stands
within the pale of god's bright summer lands
gather the soft hair round the dainty head
as in past days who says that she is dead
and nevermore will heed the old commands
to your cold idols cling i know she sleeps
that her pure soul is not by vexed winds tost
along the pathless altitudes of space
this life but sows the seed from which one reaps
the future's harvest no i have not lost
the glory and the gladness of her face
spring summer autumn priestesses that hold
alternate watch at nature's altar deep
and full of mystery the course ye keep
in hidden sympathy first chastely cold
thou vestal spring most gently dost unfold
the oracles of nature and from sleep
enchanted bid her infant beauties peep
thou summer dost inscribe in living gold
the fullness of each promise sibylline
and makest in part the bright fruition thine
murmuring soft music from her leafy fane
till autumn's stores reveal in corn and wine
the meaning shut in every bud and grain
then comes the solemn pause which calls spring back again
now day survives the sun the pale grey skies
a sort of dull and dubious lustre keep
as with their own light shining nature lies
slumbering and gazing on me in her sleep
so still so mute with fixed and soul less eyes
the sun is set yet not a star is seen
distinct the landscape save where intervene
the creeping mists that from the dark stream rise
now spread into a sea with islets broken
and woodland points now poised on the thin air
in the black west the clouds a storm betoken
and all things seem a spectral gloom to wear
the cautious bat resents the lingering light
and the long folded sheep wonder it is not night
there is i think no sunshine like the sky
of those mild breezy cloudless autumn days
which tempt once more abroad the butterfly
to search for lingering flowers when the green sprays
of ash now loosened drop on him who strays
through woodland paths while the light yellow leaves
of fading trees come dancing down all ways
like wingeacuted things and oft the stream receives
full many a tiny voyager whirled along
amid its eddies  when the gossamer spreads
over the fresh clods her trembling silvery threads
and robin thinly screened his sweetest song
pours forth as if triumphant over the scene
he said spring will return and all again be green
thou wast not robbed of wonder when youth fled
but still the bud had promise to thine eyes
and beauty was not sundered from surprise
and reverent as reverend was thy head
thy life was music and thou mad'st it ours
not thine crude scorn of gentle household things
and yet thy spirit had the sea bird's wings
nor rested long among the chestnut flowers
spain's coast of charm and all the north sea's cold
thou knewest and thou knewest the soul of eld
and dusty scroll and volume we beheld
to gold transmuted  not to hard wrought gold
but that clear shining of the eastern air
when helios rising shakes the splendour of his hair
'tis midnight and pale melancholy stands
beside me wearing a funereal wreath
of yew and cypress the faint dirge of death
moans in her breathing while her withered hands
fling corse bedecking rosemary around
she offers nightshade spreads a winding sheet
points to the clinging clay upon her feet
and whispers tidings of the charnel ground
oh pray thee melancholy do not bring
these bitter emblems with thee i can bear
with all but these  'tis these oh god that wring
and plunge my heart in maddening despair
hence for awhile pale melancholy go
and let sweet slumber lull my weeping woe
with hands that folded are from every task
it must be sweet o thou my dead to lie
sealed with the seal of the great mystery
the lips that nothing answer nothing ask
the life long struggle ended ended quite
the weariness of patience and of pain
and the eyes closed to open not again
on desolate dawn or dreariness of night
it must be sweet to slumber and forget
to have the poor tired heart so still at last
done with all yearning done with all regret
doubt fear hope sorrow all for ever past
past all the hours or slow of wing or fleet
it must be sweet it must be very sweet
ye jessamines that beneath the lunar ray
unfold your virgin robes your modest grace
imparting odours you denied the day
though day's own light condensed adorns your race
ye stars that quivering midst yon azure sky
from forth your circles softened lustre stream
and raise towards you calm devotion's eye
and seed to lonely love a soothing beam
why cease you now to charm as erst ye did
why free from rapture move i now along
ye scents ye blooms ye stars in vain ye bid
your soft enchantments round my senses throng
for she is lost who greeted all your powers
she breathes no more who loved your pensive hours
thou last pale relic from yon widowed tree
hovering awhile in air as if to leave
thy native sprig reluctant how i grieve
and heave the sigh of kindred sympathy
that thou art fallen  for i too whilom played
upon the topmost bough of youth's gay spring
have sported blithe on summer's golden wing
and now i see my fleeting autumn fade
yet 'sear and yellow leaf' though thou and i
thus far resemble and this frame like thee
in the cold silent ground be doomed to lie
thou never more will climb thy parent tree
but i through faith in my redeemer trust
that i shall rise again even from the dust
go you o winds that blow from north to south
convey my secret sighs unto my sweet
deliver them from mine unto her mouth
and make my commendations till we meet
but if perhaps her proud aspiring sprite
will not accept nor yet receive the same
the breast and bulwark of her bosom beat
knock at her heart and tell from whence you came
importune her nor cease nor shrink for shame
sport with her curls of amber colored hair
and when she sighs immix yourselves with thame
give her her own and thus beguile the fair
blow winds fly sighs whereas my heart doth haunt
and secretly commend me to my saunt
now while amid those dainty downs and dales
with shepherd swains i sit unknown to me
we sweetly sing and tell pastoral tales
but my discourse and song's theme is of thee
for otherways alas how can it be
let venus leave her blest abode above
to tempt my love yet thou sweet soul shalt see
that i thy man and thou shalt die my love
no tract of time nor sad eclipse of place
nor absence long which sometime were due cures
to my disease shall make thy slave to cease
from serving thee till life or breath endures
and till we meet my rustic mates and i
through woods and plains pandora's praise shall cry
lo this is she that ruled the world draw near
over her lowers the shadow of sudden death
to morrow without heart beat pulse or breath
octavian's band shall find her lying here
there at her side among the fig leaves sere
coils the cerastes hid unseen by us
yet is within those great eyes luminous
no fear nor any moment's touch of fear
let be she is but tracing back the path
trod through the life that is to end this night
thinking of all the dead days' dear delight
lute music wine cup dance and revelry
the sensuous stillness of the scented bath
lip touch and clasp and arms of antony
children that lay their pretty garlands by
so piteously yet with a humble mind
sailors who when their ship rocks in the wind
cast out her freight with half averted eye
riches for life exchanging solemnly
lest they should never gain the wished for shore
thus we o father standing thee before
do lay down at thy feet without a sigh
each after each our precious things and rare
our dear heart jewels and our garlands fair
perhaps thou knewest that the flowers would die
and the long voyaged boards be found but dust
so took'st them while unchanged to thee we trust
for incorruptible treasure thou art just
i
i never lay me down to sleep at night
but in my heart i sing that little song
the angels hear it as a pitying throng
they touch my burning lids with fingers bright
as moonbeams pale impalpable and light
and when my daily pious tasks are done
and all my patient prayers said one by one
god hears it seems it sinful in his sight
that round my slow burnt offering of quenched will
one quivering human sigh creeps wind like still
that when my orisons celestial fail
rises one note of natural human wail
dear lord spouse hero martyr saint erelong
i trust god will forgive my singing that poor song
a year ago i bade my little son
bear upon pilgrimage a heavy load
of alms he cried half fainting on the road
mother o mother would the day were done
him i reproved with tears and said go on
nor pause nor murmur till thy task be o'er
would not god say to me the same and more
i will not sing that song thou dearest one
husband  no brother  stretch thy steadfast hand
and let mine grasp it now i also stand
my woman weakness nerved to strength like thine
we'll quaff life's aloe cup as if 't were wine
each to the other journeying on apart
till at heaven's golden doors we two leap heart to heart
there was a marriage table where one sate
haply unnoticed till they craved his aid
thenceforward does it seem that he has made
all virtuous marriage tables consecrate
and so at this where without pomp or state
we sit and only say or mute are fain
to wish the simple words god bless these twain
i think that he who in the midst doth wait
oft times would not abjure our prayerful cheer
but as at cana list with gracious ear
to us beseeching that the love divine
may ever at their household table sit
make all his servants who encompass it
and change life's bitterest waters into wine
my white archangel with thy steadfast eyes
beholding all this empty ghost filled room
thy clasped hands resting on the sword of doom
thy firm close lips not made for human sighs
or smiles or kisses sweet or bitter cries
but for divine exhorting holy song
and righteous counsel bold from seraph tongue
beautiful angel strong as thou art wise
would that the sight of thee made wise and strong
would that this sheathed sword of thine which lies
stonily idle could gleam out among
the spiritual hosts of enemies
that tempting shriek  requite thou wrong with wrong
lama sabachthani  how long how long
michael the leader of the hosts of god
who warred with satan for the body of him
whom living god had loved  if cherubim
with cherubim contended for one clod
of human dust for forty years that trod
the gloomy desert of heaven's chastisement
are there not ministering angels sent
to battle with the devils that roam abroad
clutching our living souls the living still
the living they shall praise thee  let some great
invisible spirit enter in and fill
the howling chambers of hearts desolate
with looks like thine o michael strong and wise
my white archangel with the steadfast eyes
regard me well i am thy love thy love
thy blessing thy delight thy hope thy peace
thy joy above all joys that break and cease
when their full waves in widest circles move
thy bird of comfort thine eternal dove
whom thou didst send out of thy mournful breast
to flutter back and point thee to thy rest
thine angel who forgets her crown star wove
to come to thee with folded woman hands
pleading  look on me beatrice who stands
before thee by the triune light divine
undazzled still beholds thy human face
and is more happy in this happy place
that thou alone art hers and she is thine
i see thee gliding towards me with slow pace
across the azure fields of paradise
where thine each footstep makes a star arise
so from this heart's once void but infinite space
each strange sweet touch of thy celestial grace
in the old mortal life struck out some spark
to light the world though all my heaven lay dark
o beatrice cypresses enlace
my laurels none have grown save tear bedewed
salt tears that sank into the earth unviewed
and sprang up green to form a crown of bays
take it at thy dear feet i lay my all
what men my honors virtues glories call
i lived loved suffered sung  for thy sole praise
soul spirit genius  which thou art  that whence
i know not rose upon this mortal frame
like the sun o'er the mountains all aflame
seen large through mists of childish innocence
and year by year with me uptravelling thence
as hour by hour the day star madest aspire
my nature interpenetrate with fire
it felt but understood not  strong intense
wisdom with folly mixed and gold with clay
soul thou hast journeyed with me all this way
oft hidden and o'erclouded oft arrayed
in scorching splendors that my earth life burned
yet ever unto thee my true life turned
for dim or clear 't was thou my daylight made
soul dwelling oft in god's infinitude
and sometimes seeming no more part of me
this me worms' heritage  than that sun can be
part of the earth he has with warmth imbued
whence camest thou whither goest thou i subdued
with awe of mine own being  thus sit still
dumb on the summit of this lonely hill
whose dry november grasses dew bestrewed
mirror a million suns  that sun so bright
passes as thou must pass soul into night
art thou afraid who solitary hast trod
a path i know not from a source to a bourne
both which i know not fear'st thou to return
alone even as thou camest alone to god
i
i shall not paint them god them sees and i
no other can nor need they have no form
i may not close with human kisses warm
their eyes which shine afar or from on high
but never will shine nearer till i die
how long how long see i am growing old
i have quite ceased to note in my hair's fold
the silver threads that there in ambush lie
some angel faces bent from heaven would pine
to trace the sharp lines graven upon mine
what matter in the wrinkles ploughed by care
let age tread after sowing immortal seeds
all this life's harvest yielded wheat or weeds
is reaped methinks at my little field lies bare
but in the night time 'twixt it and the stars
the angel faces still come glimmering by
no death pale shadow no averted eye
marking the inevitable doom that bars
me from them not a cloud their aspect mars
and my sick spirit walks with them hand in hand
by the cool waters of a pleasant land
sings with them o'er again without its jars
the psalm of life that ceased as one by one
their voices dropping off left mine alone
with dull monotonous wail to grieve the air
o solitary love that art so strong
i think god will have pity on thee erelong
and take thee where thou'lt find those angel faces fair
from the near city comes the clang of bells
their hundred jarring diverse tones combine
in one faint misty harmony as fine
as the soft note yon winter robin swells
what if to thee in thine infinity
these multiform and many colored creeds
seem but the robe man wraps as masquers' weeds
round the one living truth thou givest him  thee
what if these varied forms that worship prove
being heart worship reach thy perfect ear
but as a monotone complete and clear
of which the music is through christ's name love
forever rising in sublime increase
to glory in the highest  on earth peace
richard the lion hearted crowned serene
with the true royalty of perfect man
seated in stone above the praise or ban
of these mixed crowds who come gaping lean
as if to see what the word king might mean
in those old times behold what need that rim
of crown 'gainst this blue sky to signal him
a monarch of the monarchs that have been
and perhaps are not  read his destinies
in the full brow o'er arching kingly eyes
in the strong hands grasping both rein and sword
in the close mouth so sternly beautiful
surely a man who his own spirit can rule
lord of himself therefore his brethren's lord
o richard o mon roi so minstrels sighed
the many centuried voice dies fast away
amidst the turmoil of our modern day
how know we but these green wreathed legends hide
an ugly truth that never could abide
in this our living world's far purer air
nevertheless o statue rest thou there
our richard of all chivalry the pride
or if not the true richard still a type
of the old regal glory fallen o'er ripe
and giving place to better blossoming
stand  imaging the grand heroic days
and let our little children come and gaze
whispering with innocent awe  this was a king
ghosts of dead soldiers in the battle slain
ghosts of dead heroes dying nobler far
in the long patience of inglorious war
of famine cold heat pestilence and pain
all ye whose loss makes our victorious gain
this quiet night as sounds the cannon's tongue
do ye look down the trembling stars among
viewing our peace and war with like disdain
or wiser grown since reaching those new spheres
smile ye on those poor bones ye sowed as seed
for this our harvest nor regret the deed
yet lift one cry with us to heavenly ears
strike with thy bolt the next red flag unfurled
and make all wars to cease throughout the world
in face of a great sorrow like to death
how do we wrestle night and day with tears
how do we fast and pray how small appears
the outside world while hanging on some breath
of fragile hope the chamber where we lie
includes all space  but if sudden at last
the blow falls or by incredulity
fond led we  never having one thought cast
towards years where the child was not  see it die
and with it all our future all our past
we just look round us with a dull surprise
for lesser pangs we had filled earth with cries
of wild and angry grief that would be heard
but when the heart is broken  not a word
this is a day the lord hath made  thus spake
the good religious heart unstained unworn
watching the golden glory of the morn
since on each happy day that came to break
like sunlight o'er this silent life of mine
yea on each beauteous morning i saw shine
i have remembered these your words rejoiced
and been glad in it so o'er many voiced
tumultuous harmonies of tropic seas
which chant an everlasting farewell grand
between ourselves and you and the old land
receive this token many words chance sown
may oftentimes have taken root and grown
to bear food fruit perennially like these
beyond the low marsh meadows and the beach
seen through the hoary trunks of windy pines
the long blue level of the ocean shines
the distant surf with hoarse complaining speech
out from its sandy barrier seems to reach
and while the sun behind the woods declines
the moaning sea with sighing boughs combines
and waves and pines make answer each to each
o melancholy soul whom far and near
in life faith hope the same sad undertone
pursues from thought to thought thou needs must hear
an old refrain too much too long thine own
'this thy mortality infects thine ear
the mournful strain was in thyself alone
in the old void of unrecorded time
in long slow aeons of the voiceless past
a seed from out the weltering fire mist cast
took root  a struggling plant that from its prime
through rudiments uncouth through rock and slime
grew changing form and issue  and clinging fast
stretched its aspiring tendrils  till at last
shaped like a spirit it began to climb
beyond its rugged stem with leaf and bud
still burgeoning to greet the sunlit air
that clothed its regal top with love and power
and compassed it as with a heavenly flood
until it burst in bloom beyond compare
the world's consummate peerless human flower
shall that bright flower the countless ages toiled
and travailed to bring forth  shall that rare rose
whose bloom and fragrance earth and heaven unclose
their treasuries to enrich by death be foiled
its matchless splendour trampled down and spoiled
shall that celestial love  who watched its throes
through centuries of long struggles and of woes
and freed it from the old serpent round it coiled
who tended it and reared its glorious head
above the brambles and the poisonous marsh
and shielded it when zones were cased in ice
leave it to perish when the summons harsh
of death is rung  or ere its leaves are shed
transplant it to his realm of paradise
o solemn portal veiled in mist and cloud
where all who have lived throng in an endless line
forbid to tell by backward look or sign
what destiny awaits the advancing crowd
bourne crossed but once with no return allowed
dumb spectral gate terrestrial yet divine
beyond whose arch all powers and fates combine
pledged to divulge no secrets of the shroud
close close behind we step and strive to catch
some whisper in the dark some glimmering light
through circling whirls of thought intent to snatch
a drifting hope  a faith that grows to sight
and yet assured whatever may befall
that must be somehow best that comes to all
if death be final what is life with all
its lavish promises its thwarted aims
its lost ideals its dishonoured claims
its uncompleted growth a prison wall
whose heartless stones but echo back our call
an epitaph recording but our names
a puppet stage where joys and griefs and shames
furnish a demon jesters' carnival
a plan without a purpose or a form
a roofless temple an unfinished tale
and men like madrepores through calm and storm
toil die to build a branch of fossil frail
and add from all their dreams thoughts acts belief
a few more inches to a coral reef
in boyhood's days we read with keen delight
how young aladdin rubbed his lamp and raised
the towering djin whose form his soul amazed
yet who was pledged to serve him day and night
but gutenberg evoked a giant sprite
of vaster power when europe stood and gazed
to see him rub his types with ink then blazed
across the lands a glorious shape of light
who stripped the cowl from priests the crown from kings
and hand in hand with faith and science wrought
to free the struggling spirit's limèd wings
and guard the ancestral throne of sovereign thought
the world was dumb then first it found its tongue
and spake    and heaven and earth in answer rung
with streaming pennons scorning sail and oar
with steady tramp and swift revolving wheel
and even pulse from throbbing heart of steel
she plies her arrowy course from shore to shore
in vain the siren calms her steps allure
in vain the billows thunder on her keel
her giant form may toss and rock and reel
and shiver in the wintry tempest's roar
the calms and storms alike her pride can spurn
true to the day she keeps her appointed time
long leagues of ocean vanish at her stern
she drinks the air and tastes another clime
where men their former wonder fast unlearn
which hailed her coming as a thing sublime
whirling along its living freight it came
hot panting fierce yet docile to command
the roaring monster blazing through the land
athwart the night with crest of smoke and flame
like those weird bulls medea learned to tame
by sorcery yoked to plough the colchian strand
in forced obedience under jason's hand
yet modern skill outstripped this antique fame
when o'er our plains and through the rocky bar
of hills it pushed its ever lengthening line
of iron roads with gain far more divine
than when the daring argonauts from far
came for the golden fleece which like a star
hung clouded in the dragon guarded shrine
fleeter than time across the continent
through unsunned ocean depths from beach to beach
around the rolling globe thought's couriers reach
the new tuned earth like some vast instrument
tingles from zone to zone for art has lent
new nerves new pulse new motion    all to each
and each to all in swift electric speech
bound by a force unwearied and unspent
now lone katahdin talks with caucasus
the arctic ice fields with the sultry south
the sun bathed palm thrills to the pine tree's call
we for all realms were made and they for us
for all there is a soul an ear a mouth
and time and space are naught the mind is all
phoebus apollo from olympus driven
lived with admetus tending herds and flocks
and strolling o'er the pastures and the rocks
he found his life much duller than in heaven
for he had left his bow his songs his lyre
his divinations and his healing skill
and as a serf obeyed his master's will
one day a new thought waked an old desire
he took to painting with his colors seven
the sheep the cows the faces of the swains
all shapes and hues in forests and on plains
these old sun pictures all are lost or given
away among the gods man owns but half
the sun god's secret    in the photograph
all honor to that keen promethean soul
who caught the prismic hues of jove and mars
and from the glances of the dædal stars
and from the fiery sun the secret stole
that all are parts of one primeval whole
one substance beaming through creation's bars
consent and peace amid the chemic wars
of gases and of atoms yonder roll
the planets yonder baffling human thought
suns systems all whose burning hearts are wooed
to one confession    so hath science caught
those eye beams frank whose speech cannot delude
how of one stuff our mortal earth is wrought
with stars in their divine infinitude
the small enlarged the distant nearer brought
to sight made marvels in a denser age
but science turns with every year a page
in the enchanted volume of her thought
the wizard's wand no longer now is sought
yet with a cunning toy the archimage
may hear from rome vesuvius' thunders rage
and earthquake mutterings underground are caught
alike with trivial sounds would there might rise
some spiritual seer some prophet wise
whose tactile vision would avert the woes
born of conflicting forces in the state
some listener to the deep volcanic throes
below the surface    ere we cry too late
her maiden dreams were redolent of love
warm bosomed as she breathed the passionate air
of old romance and did in fancy move
'mong the gay knights who died for ladies fair
until she heard the thunder of the press
and so became a lover her heart rang
the note of love's alarm his tenderness
when in the onset all the tourney sang
and she was one of the dead ladies who
in beauty's blazon to his misty bower
with launcelot when the queen was gone withdrew
under the shadow of the tourney tower
and lilting to him through the gloaming made
his heart a lyre whereon her passion played
she was so dear so fair her memory stays
even her dying robs me not of this
that i have walked with her in mortal ways
whose tender beauty now immortal is
there are sweet flowers that bloom in ways forlorn
and sad sweet eyes whose beauty is a flower
blown in the night to which there is no morn
dream born and dying in its dewy bower
and she was such a flower her sweet eyes such
the secret hours that only the heart knows
thrill with the glamour of her tone and touch
like music that is sweetest at the close
falling to death as falls the fairest thing
beyond the power of love's recovering
time grows upon us until we exhaust
hope's possibilities and then we die
who thus of life each make a holocaust
till all we have in nature is put by
no one survives himself and none can so
reclaim the sentiment of youth that he
would like a fallen leaf re budded grow
on the bare bough of joy's mortality
oh in what charms may death himself reveal
when the life instinct turns at last to him
for supreme succour for the power to heal
that sickness of our days when all grows dim
more fragrant then than roses sweeter far
the airs that come from the old darkness are
there is a breath at midnight that comes in
sad as a sigh for then the day is dead
and the young morrow doth his course begin
sowing new dreams in many a dreamer's head
and there are two have waked in one dark bed
just as the last stroke fades in lonely air
and having whispered half awake have sped
with silent feet into sleep's poppied lair
she with the morning wakes but he is gone
her tears and kisses are of no avail
perchance it was his good bye murmured on
the midnight in death's visionary dale
ah woe she thought 'twas in sleep's fairyland
when in the dark he pressed her warm soft hand
ah where is hid if still it may survive
the cankered tooth of age and time's despite
ah where is hid that orb of glass so bright
that merlin for king ryence did contrive
that wondrous orb so bright wherein did live
or ere time had brought them into light
the forms of things unborn which to the sight
its high enchanted power would strangely give
for hope with counterfeit of this true glass
doth so beguile the lover's easy mind
still turning it to fancy's idiot eye
that reason's self forgets her majesty
to join the gaze till the fond phantoms pass
and grief and stern repentance rise behind
in gorgeous plumage azure gold and green
they trample the pale flowers and their shrill cry
troubles the garden's bright tranquillity
proud birds of beauty splendid and serene
spreading their brilliant fans screen after screen
of burnished sapphire gemmed with mimic suns
strange magic eyes that so the legend runs
will bring misfortune to this fair demesne
and my gay youth that vain and debonair
sits in the sunshine  tired at last of play
a child that finds the morning all too long
tempts with its beauty that disastrous day
when in the gathering darkness of despair
death shall strike dumb the laughing mouth of song
all the world was eden once you know
and paradise was ours everywhere
no jealous hedge joy's limits to declare
no sullen wall our garden bounds to show
no thorns did then beneath the roses grow
and winter's blast was as a dream love's kiss
a lightsome rapture every task a bliss
sweet laden as the air where lilies blow
for i was all of eden to you then
and you were all of paradise to me
and each in other all the world were we
till drenched in golden love light we again
love lavish flung its spell o'er everything
and nature's self lay 'witched within the ring
where all was eden all is eden less
the garden vanished  earth and sea and sky
the sunbeams flowers  even as you and i
all sundered stand in stricken loneliness
the tangled paradise a wilderness
of ordered isolations the great soul
which made of all things one harmonious whole
shredded to serve the fragments which caress
the separate being they curse nought but the gate
remains  fronting our life as day by day
it seeks the happiness it cast away
to snatch a venomed knowledge alas stern fate
to find its own discarded innocence
become a flaming sword to drive it thence
come build me a statue all of snow
said the medici prince and patron of art
and michael angelo aflame at heart
with noble shame to cast his visions so
in fleeting form for pride's caprices low
his muse all mutinous humbled to her part
and bade a seraph from the snow out start
he came  and perished in the noon day glow
great world proud patron of th' aspiring mind
dispenser of rewards  thou holdest still
in thrall alas the genius of mankind
exact full toll but not that he fulfil
his soul in vanities nay rather find
best worth in workers who transcend thy will
this is the maiden solitude too fair
for mortal eyes to gaze on  she who dwells
in the lone valley where the water wells
clear from the marble where the mountain air
is resinous with pines and white peaks bare
their unpolluted bosoms to the stars
and holy reverence the passage bars
to meaner souls who seek to enter there
only the worshipper at nature's shrine
may find that maiden waiting to be won
with broad calm brow and meek eyes of the dove
may drink the rarer ether all divine
and earthly toils and earthly troubles done
may win the longed for sweetness of her love
last night as one who hears a tragic jest
i woke from dreams half laughing half in tears
methought that i had journeyed in the spheres
and stood upon the planet of the blest
and found thereon a folk who prayed with zest
exceeding and through all their painful years
like strong souls struggled on 'mid hopes and fears
where dwell the gods they said we shall find rest
the gods  what gods i thought are those who so
inspire their worshippers with faith that flowers
immortal and who make them keep aglow
the flames forever on their altar towers
where dwell these gods of yours i asked  and lo
they pointed upwards to this earth of ours
the awful seers of old who wrote in words
like drops of blood great thoughts that through the night
of ages burn as eyes of lions light
deep jungle dusks who smote with songs like swords
the soul of man on its most secret chords
and made the heart of him a harp to smite
where are they where that old man lorn of sight
the king of song among these laurelled lords
but where are all the ancient singing spheres
that burst through chaos like the summer's breath
through ice bound seas where never seaman steers
burnt out gone down no star remembereth
these stars and seers well silenced through the years
the songless years of everlasting death
what know we of the dead who say these things
or of the life in death below the mould
what of the mystic laws that rule the old
grey realms beyond our poor imaginings
where death is life the bird with spray wet wings
knows more of what the deeps beneath him hold
let be warm hearts shall never wax a cold
but burn in roses through eternal springs
for all the vanished fruit and flower of time
are flower and fruit in worlds we cannot see
and all we see is as a shadow mime
of things unseen and time that comes to flee
is but the broken echo of a rhyme
in god's great epic of eternity
no not in woods nor fells nor pastures wild
nor left alone to changeful nature's care
you opened on the light and breathed the air
but one with blush like thine and look as mild
as dewy morn with love all undefiled
chose out a kindly spot and made thy bed
safe from the cruel blast and heedless tread
and watched thy birth and took thee for her child
and human hands solicitous have trained
thy slender stalk and eyes on thee have dwelt
radiant with thought and human feelings rained
into thy bosom e'en till thou hast felt
that through thy life a human virtue ran
and now art come to greet thy fellow man
whilst the moon decks herself in neptune's glass
and ponders over her image in the sea
her cloudy locks smoothing from off her face
that she may all as bright as beauty be
it is my wont to sit upon the shore
and mark with what an even grace she glides
her two concurrent paths of azure o'er
one in the heavens the other in the tides
now with a transient veil her face she hides
and ocean blackens with a human frown
now her fine screen of vapour she divides
and looks with all her light of beauty down
her splendid smile over silvering the main
spreads her the glass she looks into again
you the choice minions of the proud lipped nine
who warble at the great apollo's knee
why do you laugh at these rude lays of mine
i seek not of your brotherhood to be
i do not play the public swan nor try
to curve my proud neck on your vocal streams
in my own little isle retreated i
lost myself in my waters and my dreams
forgetful of the world forgotten too
the cygnet of my own secluded wave
i sing whilst dashing up their silver dew
for joy the petty billows try to rave
there is a still applause in solitude
fitting alike my merits and my mood
although we do not all the good we love
but still in love desire to do the same
nor leave the sins we hate but hating move
our soul and body's powers their powers to tame
the good we do god takes as done aright
that we desire to do he takes as done
the sin we shun he will with grace requite
and not impute the sin we seek to shun
but good desires produce no worser deeds
for god doth both together lightly give
because he knows a righteous man must needs
by faith that works by love forever live
then to do nought but only in desire
is love that burns but burns like painted fire
some blaze the precious beauties of their loves
by precious stones and other some by flowers
some by the planets and celestial powers
or by what else their fancy best approves
yet i by none of these will blazon mine
but only say her self herself is like
for those similitudes i much mislike
that are much used though they be divine
in saying she is like herself i say
she hath no like for she is past compare
then who aright commends this creature rare
must say she is and there of force must stay
because by words she cannot be expressed
so say she is and wond'ring owe the rest
when through the dark damp mists of tedious night
sweet lucid tints announce the cheerful day
gay beats the enthusiast heart that hails the ray
illuminating scenes of new delight
when the long dreary reign of winter past
the landscape brightens and the wild flowers bloom
when every gale wafts music and perfume
rich is the fancy's treasure sweet the soul's repast
such in the circle where felicia shines
are friendship's feelings on her blest return
friendship  who for her loss no more repines
but bids each anxious bosom cease to mourn
to hail felicia is our sweet employ
and every sense and every heart is joy
the soul of late a lovely sleeping child
spreads sudden wings and stands in radiant guise
eyed like the morn and bent upon the skies
her the blue gulf dismays not nor the wild
horizons with the wrecks of thunder piled
storm has she known and how its murmur dies
starlike through stainless heavens she would rise
and be no more with cloudy dreams beguiled
was sleep not sweet  sweet till on sleeping ears
earth's voices broke in discord now she hears
far far away diviner music move
nor shall her wing be sated of its flight
nor shall her eyes be weary of the night
while round her sweep the singing stars of love
when the impatient spirit leaves behind
the clogging hours and makes no dear delay
to drop this nessus shirt of night and day
to cast the flesh that bound and could not bind
the heart untamable the tireless mind
in equal dissolution shall the clay
that once was seer or singer flee away
it shall be fire and blown upon the wind
not us befits such change in radiance dressed
not us o earth for whom thou biddest cease
our grey endurance of the dark and cold
these eyes have watched with grief and now would rest
rest we desire and on thy bosom's peace
the long slow change to unremembering mould
heat urges secret odors from the grass
blunting the edge of silence crickets shrill
wings veer inane needles of light and pass
laced pools the warm wood shadows ebb and fill
the wind is casual loitering to crush
the sun upon his palate and to draw
pungence from pine frank fragrances from brush
sucked up through thin grey boughs as through a straw
moss green fern green and leaf and meadow green
are broken by the bare bone colored roads
less moved by stirring air than by unseen
soft footed ants and meditative toads
summer is passing taking what she brings
green scents and sounds and quick ephemeral wings
forgive me that i love you as i do
friend patient long too patient to reprove
the inconvenience of superfluous love
you feel that it molests you and 'tis true
in a light bark you sit with a full crew
your life full orbed compelled strange love to meet
becomes by such addition incomplete
because i love i leave you  o adieu
perhaps when i am gone the thought of me
may sometimes be your acceptable guest
indeed you love me but my company
old time makes tedious and to part is best
not without nature's will are natures wed
o gentle death how dear thou makest the dead
had i been worthy of the love you gave
that love withdrawn had left me sad but strong
my heart had been as silent as my tongue
my bed had been unfevered as my grave
i had not striven for what i could not save
back back to heaven my great hopes i had flung
to have much suffered having done no wrong
had seemed to me that noble part the brave
account it ever what this hour i am
affirms the unworthiness that in me lurked
some sapping poison through my substance worked
some sin not trivial though it lacked a name
which ratifies the deed that you have done
with plain approval other plea seek none
flowers i would bring if flowers could make thee fairer
and music if the muse were dear to thee
for loving these would make thee love the bearer
but sweetest songs forget their melody
and loveliest flowers would but conceal the wearer
a rose i marked and might have plucked but she
blushed as she bent imploring me to spare her
nor spoil her beauty by such rivalry
alas and with what gifts shall i pursue thee
what offerings bring what treasures lay before thee
when earth with all her floral train doth woo thee
and all old poets and old songs adore thee
and love to thee is naught from passionate mood
secured by joy's complacent plenitude
the mighty mountain plains have we two trod
both in the glow of sunset and sunrise
and lighted by the moon of southern skies
the snow white torrent of the thundering flood
we two have watched together in the wood
we two have felt the warm tears dim our eyes
while zephyrs softer than an infant's sighs
ruffled the light air of our solitude
o earth maternal earth and thou o heaven
and night first born who now e'en now dost waken
the host of stars thy constellated train
tell me if those can ever be forgiven
those abject who together have partaken
these sacraments of nature  and in vain
i saw the master of the sun he stood
high in his luminous car himself more bright
an archer of immeasurable might
on his left shoulder hung his quivered load
spurned by his steeds the eastern mountain glowed
forward his eager eye and brow of light
he bent and while both hands that arch embowed
shaft after shaft pursued the flying night
no wings profaned that godlike form around
his neck high held an ever moving crowd
of locks hung glistening while such perfect sound
fell from his bowstring that th'ethereal dome
thrilled as a dewdrop and each passing cloud
expanded whitening like the ocean foam
count each affliction whether light or grave
god's messenger sent down to thee do thou
with courtesy receive him rise and bow
and ere his shadow pass thy threshold crave
permission first his heavenly feet to lave
then lay before him all thou hast  allow
no cloud of passion to usurp thy brow
or mar thy hospitality no wave
of mortal tumult to obliterate
the soul's marmoreal calmness grief should be
like joy majestic equable sedate
confirming cleansing raising making free
strong to consume small troubles to commend
great thoughts grave thoughts thoughts lasting to the end
what ruined shapes of feudal pomp are there
in the cold moonlight fading silently
the castle with its stern baronial air
still frowning as accustomed to defy
the gothic street where desmond's chivalry
dwelt in their pride the cloistered house of prayer
the gate towers mouldering where the stream moans by
now but the owl's lone haunt and fox's lair
here once the pride of princely desmond flushed
his courtiers knelt his mailed squadrons rushed
and saintly brethren poured the choral strain
here beauty bowed her head and smiled and blushed
ah of these glories what doth now remain
the charnel of yon desecrated fane
broad but not deep along his rock chafed bed
in many a sparkling eddy winds the flood
clasped by a margin of green underwood
a castled crag with ivy garlanded
sheer o'er the torrent frowns above the mead
de burgho's towers crumbling o'er many a rood
stand gauntly out in airy solitude
backed by yon furrowed mountain's tinted head
sounds of far people mingling with the fall
of waters and the busy hum of bees
and larks in air and throstles in the trees
thrill the moist air with murmurs musical
while cottage smoke goes drifting on the breeze
and sunny clouds are floating over all
royal and saintly cashel i would gaze
upon the wreck of thy departed powers
not in the dewy light of matin hours
nor the meridian pomp of summer's blaze
but at the close of dim autumnal days
when the sun's parting glance through slanting showers
sheds o'er thy rock throned battlements and towers
such awful gleams as brighten o'er decay's
prophetic cheek at such a time methinks
there breathes from thy lone courts and voiceless aisles
a melancholy moral such as sinks
on the lone traveller's heart amid the piles
of vast persepolis on her mountain stand
or thebes half buried in the desert sand
gazing from each low bulwark of this bridge
how wonderful the contrast  dark as night
here amid cliffs and woods with headlong might
the black stream whirls through ferns and drooping sedge
'neath twisted roots moss brown and weedy ledge
gushing aloft from yonder birch clad height
leaps into air a cataract snow white
falling to gulfs obscure the mountain ridge
like a gray warder guardian of the scene
above the cloven gorge gloomily towers
o'er the dim woods a gathering tempest lowers
save where athwart the moist leaves' lucid green
a sunbeam glancing through disparted showers
sparkles along the rill with diamond sheen
a sun burst on the bay turn and behold
the restless waves resplendent in their glory
sweep glittering past yon purpled promontory
bright as apollo's breastplate  bathed in gold
yon bastioned islet gleams thin mists are rolled
translucent through each glen a mantle hoary
veils those peaked hills shapely as e'er in story
delphic or alpine or vesuvian old
minstrels have sung from rock and headland proud
the wild wood spreads its arms around the bay
the manifold mountain cones now dark now bright
now seen now lost alternate from rich light
to spectral shade and each dissolving cloud
reveals new mountains as it floats away
not only that thy puissant arm could bind
the tyrant of a world and conquering fate
enfranchise europe do i deem thee great
but that in all thy actions i do find
exact propriety no gusts of mind
fitful and wild but that continuous state
of ordered impulse mariners await
in some benignant and enriching wind
the breath ordained of nature thy calm mien
recalls old rome as much as thy high deed
duty thine only idol and serene
when all are troubled in the utmost need
prescient thy country's servant ever seen
yet sovereign of thyself whate'er may speed
there is a soul above the soul of each
a mightier soul which yet to each belongs
there is a sound made of all human speech
and numerous as the concourse of all songs
and in that soul lives each in each that soul
though all the ages are its lifetime vast
each soul that dies in its most sacred whole
receiveth life that shall for ever last
and thus for ever with a wider span
humanity o'erarches time and death
man can elect the universal man
and live in life that ends not with his breath
and gather glory that increases still
till time his glass with death's last dust shall fill
deign at my hands this crown of prayer and praise
weav'd in my low devout melancholy
thou which of good hast yea art treasury
all changing unchanged ancient of days
but do not with a vile crown of frail bays
reward my muse's white sincerity
but what thy thorny crown gained that give me
a crown of glory which doth flower always
the ends crown our works but thou crown'st our ends
for at our end begins our endlesse rest
the first last end now zealously possest
with a strong sober thirst my soul attends
'tis time that heart and voice be lifted high
salvation to all that will is nigh
salvation to all that will is nigh
that all which always is all everywhere
which cannot sin and yet all sins must bear
which cannot die yet cannot choose but die
loe faithful virgin yields himself to lie
in prison in thy womb and though he there
can take no sin nor thou give yet he'will wear
taken from thence flesh which death's force may try
ere by the spheres time was created thou
wast in his mind who is thy son and brother
whom thou conceiv'st conceiv'd yea thou art now
thy maker's maker and thy father's mother
thou hast light in dark and shutst in little room
immensity cloistered in thy dear womb
immensity cloistered in thy dear womb
now leaves his welbelov'd imprisonment
there he hath made himself to his intent
weak enough now into our world to come
but oh for thee for him hath th'inne no roome
yet lay him in this stall and from the orient
stars and wisemen will travel to prevent
th'effect of herod's jealous general doom
seest thou my soul with thy faith's eyes how he
which fills all place yet none holds him doth lie
was not his pity towards thee wondrous high
that would have need to be pitied by thee
kiss him and with him into egypt goe
with his kind mother who partakes thy woe
with his kind mother who partakes thy woe
joseph turn back see where your child doth sit
blowing yea blowing out those sparks of wit
which himself on the doctors did bestow
the word but lately could not speake and loe
it suddenly speaks wonders whence comes it
that all which was and all which should be writ
a shallow seeming child should deeply know
his godhead was not soul to his manhood
nor had time mellow'd him to this ripenesse
but as for one which hath a long task 'tis good
with the sunne to begin his businesse
he in his age's morning thus began
by miracles exceeding power of man
by miracles exceeding power of man
he faith in some envy in some begat
for what weake spirits admire ambitious hate
in both affections many to him ran
but oh the worst are most they will and can
alas and do unto the immaculate
whose creature fate is now prescribe a fate
measuring selfe life's infinity to a span
nay to an inch loe where condemned he
bears his own cross with pain yet by and by
when it bears him he must bear more and die
now thou art lifted up draw me to thee
and at thy death giving such liberal dole
moist with one drop of thy blood my dry soule
moist with one drop of thy blood my dry soule
shall though she now be in extreme degree
too stony hard and yet too fleshly be
freed by that drop from being starved hard or foul
and life by this death abled shall control
death whom thy death slew nor shall to me
fear of first or last death bring misery
if in thy little book my name thou enroll
flesh in that long sleep is not putrified
but made that there of which and for which 'twas
nor can by other means be glorified
may then sins sleep and deaths soon from me pass
that waked from both i again risen may
salute the last and everlasting day
salute the last and everlasting day
joy at the uprising of this sunne and sonne
ye whose just tears or tribulation
have purely washed or burnt your drossy clay
behold the highest parting hence away
lightens the dark clouds which he treads upon
nor doth he by ascending show alone
but first he and he first enters the way
o strong ram which hast battered heaven for me
mild lamb which with thy blood hast marked the path
bright torch which shin'st that i the way may see
oh with thy own blood quench thy own just wrath
and if the holy spirit my muse did raise
deign at my hands this crown of prayer and praise
thou hast made me and shall thy work decay
repair me now for now mine end doth haste
i run to death and death meets me as fast
and all my pleasures are like yesterday
i dare not move my dim eyes any way
despair behind and death before doth cast
such terror and my feeble flesh doth waste
by sin in it which it t'wards hell doth weigh
only thou art above and when towards thee
by thy leave i can look i rise again
but our old subtle foe so tempteth me
that not one hour my self i can sustain
thy grace may wing me to prevent his art
and thou like adamant draw mine iron heart
as due by many ttles i resign
my self to thee o god first i was made
by thee and for thee and when i was decayed
thy blood bought that the which before was thine
i am thy son made with thy self to shine
thy servant whose pains thou hast still repaid
thy sheep thine image and till i betrayed
my self a temple of thy spirit divine
why doth the devil then usurp on me
why doth he steal nay ravish that's thy right
except thou rise and for thine own work fight
oh i shall soon despair when i do see
that thou lov'st mankind well yet wilt not choose me
and satan hates me yet is loth to lose me
o might those sighs and tears return again
into my breast and eyes which i have spent
that i might in this holy discontent
mourn with some fruit as i have mourned in vain
in mine idolatry what showers of rain
mine eyes did waste what griefs my heart did rent
that sufferance was my sin now i repent
'cause i did suffer i must suffer pain
th' hydropic drunkard and night scouting thief
the itchy lecher and self tickling proud
have the remembrance of past joys for relief
of comming ills to poor me is allowed
no ease for long yet vehement grief hath been
th' effect and cause the punishment and sin
oh my black soul now art thou summoned
by sickness death's herald and champion
thou art like a pilgrim which abroad hath done
treason and durst not turn to whence he is fled
or like a thief which till death's doom be read
wisheth himself delivered from prison
but damned and haled to execution
wisheth that still he might be imprisoned
yet grace if thou repent thou canst not lack
but who shall give thee that grace to begin
oh make thy self with holy mourning black
and red with blushing as thou art with sin
or wash thee in christ's blood which hath this might
that being red it dyes red souls to white
at the round earth's imagined corners blow
your trumpets angels and arise arise
from death you numberless infinities
of souls and to your scattered bodies go
all whom the flood did and fire shall o'erthrow
all whom war dearth age agues tyrannies
despair law chance hath slain and you whose eyes
shall behold god and never taste death's woe
but let them sleep lord and me mourn a space
for if above all these my sins abound
'tis late to ask abundance of thy grace
when we are there here on this lowly ground
teach me how to repent for that's as good
as if thou hadst seal'd my pardon with thy blood
if faithful souls be alike glorified
as angels then my father's soul doth see
and adds this even to full felicity
that valiantly i hell's wide mouth o'erstride
but if our minds to these souls be descried
by circumstances and by signs that be
apparent in us not immediately
how shall my mind's white truth by them be tried
they see idolatrous lovers weep and mourn
and vile blasphemous conjurers to call
on jesus name and pharisaical
dissemblers feigne devotion then turn
o pensive soul to god for he knows best
thy true grief for he put it in my breast
death be not proud though some have called thee
mighty and dreadful for thou art not so
for those whom thou think'st thou dost overthrow
die not poor death nor yet canst thou kill me
from rest and sleep which but thy pictures be
much pleasure then from thee much more must flow
and soonest our best men with thee do go
rest of their bones and soul's delivery
thou art slave to fate chance kings and desperate men
and dost with poison war and sickness dwell
and poppy or charms can make us sleep as well
and better than thy stroke why swell'st thou then
one short sleep past we wake eternally
and death shall be no more death thou shalt die
spit in my face you jews and pierce my side
buffet and scoff scourge and crucify me
for i have sinned and sinned and only he
who could do no iniquity hath died
but by my death can not be satisfied
my sins which pass the jews' impiety
they killed once an inglorious man but i
crucify him daily being now glorified
oh let me then his strange love still admire
kings pardon but he bore our punishment
and jacob came clothed in vile harsh attire
but to supplant and with gainful intent
god clothed himself in vile man's flesh that so
he might be weak enough to suffer woe
why are we by all creatures waited on
why do the prodigal elements supply
life and food to me being more pure than i
simple and further from corruption
why brook'st thou ignorant horse subjection
why dost thou bull and bore so seelily
dissemble weakness and by one man's stroke die
whose whole kind you might swallow and feed upon
weaker i am woe is me and worse than you
you have not sinned nor need be timorous
but wonder at a greater wonder for to us
created nature doth these things subdue
but their creator whom sin nor nature tied
for us his creatures and his foes hath died
what if this present were the world's last night
mark in my heart o soul where thou dost dwell
the picture of christ crucified and tell
whether that countenance can thee affright
tears in his eyes quench the amazing light
blood fills his frowns which from his pierced head fell
and can that tongue adjudge thee unto hell
which prayed forgiveness for his foes' fierce spite
no no but as in my idolatry
i said to all my profane mistresses
beauty of pity foulness only is
a sign of rigour so i say to thee
to wicked spirits are horrid shapes assigned
this beauteous form assures a piteous mind
batter my heart three person'd god for you
as yet but knock breathe shine and seek to mend
that i may rise and stand o'erthrow me and bend
your force to break blow burn and make me new
i like an usurpt town to another due
labour to admit you but oh to no end
reason your viceroy in me me should defend
but is captiv'd and proves weak or untrue
yet dearly i love you and would be loved fain
but am betroth'd unto your enemy
divorce me untie or break that knot again
take me to you imprison me for i
except you enthrall me never shall be free
nor ever chaste except you ravish me
wilt thou love god as he thee then digest
my soul this wholesome meditation
how god the spirit by angels waited on
in heaven doth make his temple in thy breast
the father having begot a son most blest
and still begetting for he ne'er be gone
hath deigned to choose thee by adoption
co heir t' his glory and sabbath' endless rest
and as a robbed man which by search doth find
his stol'n stuff sold must lose or buy 't again
the son of glory came down and was slain
us whom he'd made and satan stol'n to unbind
'twas much that man was made like god before
but that god should be made like man much more
father part of his double interest
unto thy kingdom thy son gives to me
his jointure in the knotty trinity
he keeps and gives to me his death's conquest
this lamb whose death with life the world hath blest
was from the world's beginning slain and he
hath made two wills which with the legacy
of his and thy kingdom do thy sons invest
yet such are thy laws that men argue yet
whether a man those statutes can fulfil
none doth but all healing grace and spirit
revive again what law and letter kill
thy law's abridgement and thy last command
is all but love oh let this last will stand
oh to vex me contraries meet in one
inconstancy unnaturally hath begot
a constant habit that when i would not
i change in vows and in devotion
as humorous is my contrition
as my profane love and as soon forgot
as riddlingly distempered cold and hot
as praying as mute as infinite as none
i durst not view heaven yesterday and today
in prayers and flattering speeches i court god
tomorrow i quake with true fear of his rod
so my devout fits come and go away
like a fantastic ague save that here
those are my best days when i shake with fear
o earth that had so long in darkness lain
waiting and listening for the voice that cried
let there be light  on thy first eventide
what woe what fear wrung thy dumb soul with pain
in darkling space down dropt the red sun slain
with all his banners drooping far and wide
spread desolation's vast and blackening tide
how couldst thou know that day would dawn again
but the long hours wore on till lo pale gleams
of faint far glory lit the eastern skies
broadening and reddening till the sun's full beams
broke in clear golden splendour on thine eyes
darkness and brooding anguish were but dreams
lost in a trembling wonder of surprise
even so o life all tremulous with woe
thou too didst cower when without sound or jar
from the high zenith sinking fast and far
thy sun went out of heaven how couldst thou know
in that dark hour that never tide could flow
so ebon black nor ever mountain bar
breast night so deep without or moon or star
but that the morning yet again must glow
god never leaves thee in relentless dark
slowly the dawn on unbelieving eyes
breaketh at last day brightens  and oh hark
a flood of bird song from the tender skies
from storm and darkness thou hast found an ark
shut in with this great marvel of surprise
come blessed darkness come and bring thy balm
for eyes grown weary of the garish day
come with thy soft slow steps thy garments grey
thy veiling shadows bearing in thy palm
the poppy seeds of slumber deep and calm
come with thy patient stars whose far off ray
steals the hot fever of the soul away
thy stillness sweeter than a chanted psalm
o blessed darkness day indeed is fair
and light is dear when summer days are long
and one by one the harvesters go by
but so is rest sweet and surcease from care
and folded palms and hush of evensong
and all the unfathomed silence of the sky
mysterious one inscrutable unknown
a silent presence with averted face
whose lineaments no mortal eye can trace
and robes of trailing darkness round thee thrown
over the midnight hills thou comest alone
what thou dost bring to me from farthest space
what blessing or what ban what dole what grace
i may not know thy secrets are thine own
yet asking not for lightest word or sign
to tell me what the hidden fate may be
without a murmur or a quickened breath
unshrinkingly i place my hand in thine
and through the shadowy depths go forth with thee
to meet as thou shalt lead or life or death
then if i fear not thee thou veileacuted one
whose face i know not why fear i to meet
beyond the everlasting hills her feet
who cometh when all yesterdays are done
shall i who have proved thee good thy sister shun
o thou to morrow who dost feel the beat
of life's long rhythmic pulses strong and sweet
in the far realm that hath no need of sun
thou who art fairer than the fair to day
that i have held so dear and loved so much
when slow descending from the hills divine
thou summonest me to join thee on thy way
let me not shrink nor tremble at thy touch
nor fear to break thy bread and drink thy wine
o earth art thou not weary of thy graves
dear patient mother earth upon thy breast
how are they heaped from farthest east to west
from the dim north where wild the storm wind raves
o'er the cold surge that chills the shore it laves
to sunlit isles by softest seas caressed
where roses bloom alway and song birds nest
how thick they lie  like flecks upon the waves
there is no mountain top so far and high
no desert so remote no vale so deep
no spot by man so long untenanted
but the pale moon slow marching up the sky
sees over some lone grave the shadows creep
o earth art thou not weary of thy dead
once by the dusk light of an ancient hall
i saw a horologe its minutes fell
upon the roused ear with a drowsy knell
that he who passed attended to the call
i looked and lo five antics over all
one moved and four were motionless the one
was scythed and bald head time and he mowed on
sweep after sweep  and each a minute's fall
the four were kings sceptres they bore and globes
and ermined crowns before that old man dim
they stood but not in joy at sight of time
they had stiffened into statues in their robes
fear petrified  let no man envy him
who smiles at that grave homily sublime
go take thine angle and with practised line
light as the gossamer the current sweep
and if thou failest in teh calm still deep
in the rough eddy may the prize be thine
say thou'rt unlucky where the sunbeams shine
beneath teh shadow where the waters creep
perchance the monarch of the brook shall leap
for fate is ever better than design
still persevere the giddiest breeze that blows
for thee may blow with fame and fortune rife
be prosperous  and what reck if it arose
out of some pebble with the stream at strife
or that the light wind dallied with the boughs
thou art successful  such is human life
i dreamed of him last night i saw his face
all radiant and unshadowed of distress
and as of old in music measureless
i heard his golden voice and marked him trace
under the common thing the hidden grace
and conjure wonder out of emptiness
till mean things put on beauty like a dress
and all the world was an enchanted place
and then methought outside a fast locked gate
i mourned the loss of unrecorded words
forgotten tales and mysteries half said
wonders that might have been articulate
and voiceless thoughts like murdered singing birds
and so i woke and knew that he was dead
not all the singers of a thousand years
can open english prisons no though hell
opened for tracian orpheus now the spell
of song and art is powerless as the tears
that love has shed you that were full of fears
and mean self love shall live to know full well
that you yourselves not he were pitiable
when you met mercy's voice with frowns or jeers
and did you ask who signed the plea with you
fools it was signed already with the sign
of great dead men of god like socrates
shakespeare and plato and the florentine
who conquered form and all your pretty crew
once and once only might have stood with these
see what a mass of gems the city wears
upon her broad live bosom row on row
rubies and emeralds and amethysts glow
see that huge circle like a necklace stares
with thousands of bold eyes to heaven and dares
the golden stars to dim the lamps below
and in the mirror of the mire i know
the moon has left her image unawares
that's the great town at night i see her breasts
pricked out with lamps they stand like huge black towers
i think they move i hear her panting breath
and that's her head where the tiara rests
and in her brain through lanes as dark as death
men creep like thoughtsthe lamps are like pale flowers
what shall we do my soul to please the king
seeing he hath no pleasure in the dance
and hath condemned the honeyed utterance
of silver flutes and mouths made round to sing
along the wall red roses climb and cling
and oh my prince lift up thy countenance
for there be thoughts like roses that entrance
more than the languors of soft lute playing
think how the hidden things that poets see
in amber eves or mornings crystalline
hide in the soul their constant quenchless light
till called by some celestial alchemy
out of forgotten depths they rise and shine
like buried treasure on midsummer night
to see the moment holds a madrigal
to find some cloistered place some hermitage
for free devices some deliberate cage
wherein to keep wild thoughts like birds in thrall
to eat sweet honey and to taste black gall
to fight with form to wrestle and to rage
till at the last upon the conquered page
the shadows of created beauty fall
this is the sonnet this is all delight
of every flower that blows in every spring
and all desire of every desert place
this is the joy that fills a cloudy night
when bursting from her misty following
a perfect moon wins to an empty space
i know a green grass path that leaves the field
and like a running river winds along
into a leafy wood where is no throng
of birds at noon day and no soft throats yield
their music to the moon the place is sealed
an unclaimed sovereignty of voiceless song
and all the unravished silences belong
to some sweet singer lost or unrevealed
so is my soul become a silent place
oh may i wake from this uneasy night
to find a voice of music manifold
let it be shape of sorrow with wan face
or love that swoons on sleep or else delight
that is as wide eyed as a marigold
the man that's poor and prosecutes the muse
said i alas is like to lose his cause
so i resolved with her to have a truce
quite well aware i could not learn her laws
though some assert that hers like ours have flaws
which let her pleaders 'peach i'm even content
to own her power and give my bickerings pause
a liegeman to her gambol government
for late as sauntering through the woods i went
she met me smiling come said i let's plight
our troth again quoth she with lips up bent
we're not so near akin but what we might
so now we lead a joyous jangling life
and kiss and quarrel  just like man and wife
sure merry may thy reign is near allied
to that of early love  thy subjects play
blushing in bloom and pranked in frolic pride
right freshly shines thy blithe and breezy day
in the green shade that scarce excludes the ray
the insect hum is up the brilliant fly
lights on a sunny leaf and glistens gay
while the coy blackcap warbles wildly nigh
quick shoots the gossamer all reddening bright
with sunny glance the sharp winged swallows high
sail nimbly and full many a flowret's eye
looks eager on thy realm with flush delight
sure thou art akin to love sweet may  and i
perchance could tell some other reason why
there are who say the sonnet's meted maze
is all too fettered for the poet's powers
compelled to crowd his flush and airy flowers
like pots of tall imperials ill at ease
or should some tiny thought his fancy seize
a violet on a vase's top it towers
and mid the mass of leaves he round it showers
its little cap and tippet scarce can raise
others assert the sonnet's proper praise
like petalled flowers to each its due degree
the king cup five the pilewort eight bright rays
the speedwell four the green tipped snowdrop three
so mid the bard's all petalled sorts is seen
the sonnet  simple flowret of fourteen
reynolds no more as erst two frolic boys
by severn's side our school day tricks we try
for me now holds the love of rural joys
thee city pomp light sock and buskin high
yet distance dares not bid us leave to ply
the social sheet or court our mutual muse
for distance cannot time tied souls untie
nor dim the long horizon of their views
but never let my woods their leafage lose
till thou hast there admired ripe august glow
nor shall in turn my friendly foot refuse
to beat thy threshold with december's snow
so shalt thou love my rural joys and i
approve thy scenic pomp light sock and buskin high
that was the thrush's last good night i thought
and heard the soft descent of summer rain
in the drooped garden leaves but hush again
the perfect iterence  freer than unsought
odours of violets dim in woodland ways
deeper than coiled waters laid a dream
below mossed ledges of a shadowy stream
and faultless as blown roses in june days
full throated singer art thou thus anew
voiceful to hear how round thyself alone
the enriched silence drops for thy delight
more soft than snow more sweet than honey dew
now cease the last faint western streak is gone
stir not the blissful quiet of the night
i have wept tears and learnt i fear sad ways
of searching for a smile and i can guess
the secret of a wan mouth's droopingness
and know which eyes are they that waste their gaze
on the hid grave of hop  yet ne'er the less
my heart leaps up to utter thanks and bless
our earth which bears sweet flowers and the glad face
of these unwearied waters  thanks to them
for brief intense bright moments when we see
our life stand clear in joy we kiss the hem
of god's robe in a rapture and are whole
on wind swept hill tops by the mystery
of ocean on still morns or when the soul
springs to the lark in a fine ecstasy
when thou would'st have me go with thee o death
over the utmost verge to the dim place
practise upon me with no amorous grace
of fawning lips and words of delicate breath
and curious music thy lute uttereth
nor think for me there must be sought out ways
of cloud and terror have we many days
sojourned together and is this thy faith
nay be there plainness 'twixt us come to me
even as thou art o brother of my soul
hold thy hand out and i will place mine there
i trust thy mouth's inscrutable irony
and dare to lay my forehead where the whole
shadow lies deep of thy purpureal hair
if any sense in mortal dust remains
when mine has been refined from flower to flower
won from the sun all colours drunk the shower
and delicate winy dews and gained the gains
which elves who sleep in airy bells a swing
through half a summer day for love bestow
then in some warm old garden let me grow
to such a perfect lush ambrosian thing
as this  upon a southward facing wall
i bask and feel my juices dimly fed
and mellowing while my bloom comes golden grey
keep the wasps from me but before i fall
pluck me white fingers and o'er two ripe red
girl lips o let me richly swoon away
the altar lights burn low the incense fume
sickens  o listen how the priestly prayer
runs as a fenland stream a dim despair
hails through their chaunt of praise who here inhume
a clay cold faith within its carven tomb
but come thou forth into the vital air
keen dark and pure grave night is no betrayer
and if perchance some faint cold star illume
her brow of mystery shall we walk forlorn
an altar of the natural rock may rise
somewhere for men who seek there may be borne
on the night wind authentic prophecies
if not let this  to breathe sane breath  suffice
till in yon east mayhap the dark be worn
the bow of promise this last flaring star
terror and hope are in mid heaven but she
the mighty wing'd crown'd lady melancholy
heeds not  o to what vision'd goal afar
does her thought bear those steadfast eyes which are
a torch in darkness  there nor shore nor sea
nor ebbing time vexes eternity
where that lone thought outsoars the mortal bar
tools of the brain  the globe the cube  no more
she deals with in her hand the compass stays
nor those industrious genius of her lore
student and scribe thou gravest of the fays
expect this secret to enlarge thy store
she moves through incommunicable ways
make thyself known sibyl or let despair
of knowing thee be absolute i wait
hour long and waste a soul  what word of fate
hides 'twixt the lips which smile and still forbear
secret perfection  mystery too fair
tangle the sense no more lest i should hate
thy delicate tyranny the inviolate
poise of thy folded hands thy fallen hair
nay nay  i wrong thee with rough words still be
serene victorious inaccessible
still smile but speak not lightest irony
lurk ever 'neath thine eyelids' shadow still
o'ertop our knowledge sphinx of italy
allure us and reject us at thy will
high instincts dim perversions sacred fears
whence issuing  are they but the brain's amassed
tradition shapings of a barbarous past
remoulded ever by the younger years
mixed with fresh clay and kneaded with new tears
no more  the dead chief's ghost a shadow cast
across the roving clan and thence at last
comes god who in the soul his law uprears
is this the whole  has not the future powers
to match the past  attractions pulsings tides
and voices for purged ears  is all our light
the glow of ancient sunsets and lost hours
advance no banners up heaven's eastern sides
trembles the margin with no portent bright
the grass around my limbs is deep and sweet
yonder the house has lost its shadow wholly
the blinds are dropped and softly now and slowly
the day flows in and floats a calm retreat
of tempered light where fair things fair things meet
white busts and marble dian make it holy
within a niche hangs durer's melancholy
brooding and should you enter there will greet
your sense with vague allurement effluence faint
of one magnolia bloom fair fingers draw
from the piano chopin's heart complaint
alone white robed she sits a fierce macaw
on the verandah proud of plume and paint
screams insolent despot showing beak and claw
light ebbs from off the earth the fields are strange
dark trackless tenantless now the mute sky
resigns itself to night and memory
and no wind will yon sunken clouds derange
no glory enrapture them from cot or grange
the rare voice ceases one long breathed sigh
and steeped in summer sleep the world must lie
all things are acquiescing in the change
hush while the vaulted hollow of the night
deepens what voice is this the sea sends forth
disconsolate iterance a passionless moan
ah now the day is gone and tyrannous light
and the calm presence of fruit bearing earth
cry sea it is thy hour thou art alone
with brain o'erworn with heart a summer clod
with eye so practised in each form around
and all forms mean  to glance above the ground
irks it each day of many days we plod
tongue tied and deaf along life's common road
but suddenly we know not how a sound
of living streams an odour a flower crowned
with dew a lark upspringing from the sod
and we awake o joy of deep amaze
beneath the everlasting hills we stand
we hear the voices of the morning seas
and earnest prophesyings in the land
while from the open heaven leans forth at gaze
the encompassing great cloud of witnesses
a lonely way and as i went my eyes
could not unfasten from the spring's sweet things
lush sprouted grass and all that climbs and clings
in loose deep hedges where the primrose lies
in her own fairness buried blooms surprise
the plunderer bee and stop his murmurings
and the glad flutter of a finch's wings
outstartle small blue speckled butterflies
blissfully did one speedwell plot beguile
my whole heart long i loved each separate flower
kneeling i looked up suddenly  dear god
there stretched the shining plain for many a mile
the mountains rose with what invincible power
and how the sky was fathomless and broad
a while we wandered thus it is i dream
through a long sandy track of no man's land
where only poppies grew among the sand
the which we plucking cast with scant esteem
and ever sadlier into the sad stream
which followed us as we went hand in hand
under the estranged stars a road unplanned
seeing all things in the shadow of a dream
and ever sadlier as the stars expired
we found the poppies rarer till thine eyes
grown all my light to light me were too tired
and at their darkening that no surmise
might haunt me of the lost days we desired
after them all i flung those memories
with delicate mad hands behind his sordid bars
surely he hath his posies which they tear and twine
those scentless wisps of straw that miserably line
his strait caged universe whereat the dull world stares
pedant and pitiful o how his rapt gaze wars
with their stupidity  know they what dreams divine
lift his long laughing reveries like enchaunted wine
and make his melancholy germane to the stars
o lamentable brother if those pity thee
am i not fain of all thy lone eyes promise me
half a fool's kingdom far from men who sow and reap
all their days vanity  better than mortal flowers
thy moon kissed roses seem better than love or sleep
the star crowned solitude of thine oblivious hours
let us go hence the night is now at hand
the day is overworn the birds all flown
and we have reaped the crops the gods have sown
despair and death deep darkness o'er the land
broods like an owl we cannot understand
laughter or tears for we have only known
surpassing vanity vain things alone
have driven our perverse and aimless band
let us go hence somewhither strange and cold
to hollow lands where just men and unjust
find end of labour where's rest for the old
freedom to all from love and fear and lust
twine our torn hands  o pray the earth enfold
our life sick hearts and turn them into dust
is thy heart weary of unfeeling men
and chilled with the world's ice then come with me
and i will bring thee to a pleasant glen
lovely and lonely there we'll sit unviewed
by scoffing eye and let our hearts beat free
with their own mutual throb for wild and rude
the access is and none will there intrude
to poison our free thoughts and mar our solitude
such scenes move not their feelings  for they hold
no fellowship with nature's loneliness
the frozen wave reflects not back the gold
and crimson flushes of the sunset hour
the rock lies cold in sunshine  not the power
of heaven's bright orb can clothe its barrenness
like an adventurous seafarer am i
who hath some long and dang'rous voyage been
and called to tell of his discovery
how far he sailed what countries he had seen
proceeding from the port whence he put forth
shows by his compass how his course he steered
when east when west when south and when by north
as how the pole to ev'ry place was reared
what capes he doubled of what continent
the gulfs and straits that strangely he had passed
where most becalmed where with foul weather spent
and on what rocks in peril to be cast
thus in my love time calls me to relate
my tedious travels and oft varying fate
as other men so i myself do muse
why in this sort i wrest invention so
and why these giddy metaphors i use
leaving the path the greater part do go
i will resolve you i am lunatic
and ever this in madmen you shall find
what they last thought of when the brain grew sick
in most distraction they keep that in mind
thus talking idly in this bedlam fit
reason and i you must conceive are twain
'tis nine years now since first i lost my wit
bear with me then though troubled be my brain
with diet and correction men distraught
not too far past may to their wits be brought
to nothing fitter can i thee compare
than to the son of some rich penny father
who having now brought on his end with care
leaves to his son all he had heaped together
this new rich novice lavish of his chest
to one man gives doth on another spend
then here he riots yet amongst the rest
haps to lend some to one true honest friend
thy gifts thou in obscurity dost waste
false friends thy kindness born but to deceive thee
thy love that is on the unworthy placed
time hath thy beauty which with age will leave thee
only that little which to me was lent
i give thee back when all the rest is spent
a witless gallant a young wench that wooed
yet his dull spirit her not one jot could move
entreated me as e'er i wished his good
to write him but one sonnet to his love
when i as fast as e'er my pen could trot
poured out what first from quick invention came
nor never stood one word thereof to blot
much like his wit that was to use the same
but with my verses he his mistress won
who doted on the dolt beyond all measure
but see for you to heav'n for phrase i run
and ransack all apollo's golden treasure
yet by my froth this fool his love obtains
and i lose you for all my wit and pains
methinks i see some crooked mimic jeer
and tax my muse with this fantastic grace
turning my papers asks what have we here
making withal some filthy antic face
i fear no censure nor what thou canst say
nor shall my spirit one jot of vigor lose
think'st thou my wit shall keep the pack horse way
that ev'ry dudgeon low invention goes
since sonnets thus in bundles are impressed
and ev'ry drudge doth dull our satiate ear
think'st thou my love shall in those rags be dressed
that ev'ry dowdy ev'ry trull doth wear
up to my pitch no common judgment flies
i scorn all earthly dung bred scarabies
our floods' queen thames for ships and swans is crowned
and stately severn for her shore is praised
the crystal trent for fords and fish renowned
and avon's fame to albion's cliffs is raised
carlegion chester vaunts her holy dee
york many wonders of her ouse can tell
the peak her dove whose banks so fertile be
and kent will say her medway doth excel
cotswold commends her isis to the tame
our northern borders boast of tweed's fair flood
our western parts extol their wylye's fame
and the old lea brags of the danish blood
arden's sweet anker let thy glory be
that fair idea only lives by thee
some misbelieving and profane in love
when i do speak of miracles by thee
may say that thou art flattered by me
who only write my skill in verse to prove
see miracles ye unbelieving see
a dumb born muse made to express the mind
a cripple hand to write yet lame by kind
one by thy name the other touching thee
blind were mine eyes till they were seen of thine
and mine ears deaf by thy fame healed be
my vices cured by virtues sprung from thee
my hopes revived which long in grave had lyne
all unclean thoughts foul spirits cast out in me
only by virtue that proceeds from thee
dear why should you command me to my rest
when now the night doth summon all to sleep
methinks this time becometh lovers best
night was ordained together friends to keep
how happy are all other living things
which though the day disjoin by several flight
the quiet evening yet together brings
and each returns unto his love at night
o thou that art so courteous unto all
why shouldst thou night abuse me only thus
that every creature to his kind dost call
and yet 'tis thou dost only sever us
well could i wish it would be ever day
if when night comes you bid me go away
some men there be which like my method well
and much commend the strangeness of my vein
some say i have a passing pleasing strain
some say that in my humor i excel
some who not kindly relish my conceit
they say as poets do i use to feign
and in bare words paint out my passion's pain
thus sundry men their sundry minds repeat
i pass not i how men affected be
nor who commends or discommends my verse
it pleaseth me if i my woes rehearse
and in my lines if she my love may see
only my comfort still consists in this
writing her praise i cannot write amiss
whilst thus my pen strives to eternize thee
age rules my lines with wrinkles in my face
where in the map of all my misery
is modeled out the world of my disgrace
whilst in despite of tyrannizing times
medea like i make thee young again
proudly thou scorn'st my world outwearing rhymes
and murther'st virtue with thy coy disdain
and though in youth my youth untimely perish
to keep thee from oblivion and the grave
ensuing ages yet my rhymes shall cherish
where i entombed my better part shall save
and though this earthly body fade and die
my name shall mount upon eternity
in pride of wit when high desire of fame
gave life and courage to my lab'ring pen
and first the sound and virtue of my name
won grace and credit in the ears of men
with those the thronged theaters that press
i in the circuit for the laurel strove
where the full praise i freely must confess
in heat of blood a modest mind might move
with shouts and claps at ev'ry little pause
when the proud round on ev'ry side hath rung
sadly i sit unmoved with the applause
as though to me it nothing did belong
no public glory vainly i pursue
all that i seek is to eternize you
since there's no help come let us kiss and part
nay i have done you get no more of me
and i am glad yea glad with all my heart
that thus so cleanly i myself can free
shake hands for ever cancel all our vows
and when we meet at any time again
be it not seen in either of our brows
that we one lot of former love retain
now at the last gasp of love's latest breath
when his pulse failing passion speechless lies
when faith is kneeling by his bed of death
and innocence is closing up his eyes
now if thou would'st when all have given him over
from death to life thou might'st him yet recover
truce gentle love a parley now i crave
methinks 'tis long since first these wars begun
nor thou nor i the better yet can have
bad is the match where neither party won
i offer free conditions of fair peace
my heart for hostage that it shall remain
discharge our forces here let malice cease
so for my pledge thou give me pledge again
or if no thing but death will serve thy turn
still thirsting for subversion of my state
do what thou canst raze massacre and burn
let the world see the utmost of thy hate
i send defiance since if overthrown
thou vanquishing the conquest is mine own
a lifeless solitude  an angry waste
searing our alien eyes with horrors bare
no fertilizing cloud  no genial air
to mitigate its savageness of breast
the light itself all undiffusive there
motionless terror clinging to the crest
of steepmost pinnacles as by despair
unfathomable caverns still possessed
how shall we designate such world forlorn
what nook of heaven abhors this portent dark
lo where the moon reveals her gentle ray
waking the nightingale's and poet's lay
speeding benign the voyager's return
and lighting furtive kisses to their mark
in my first years and prime yet not at height
when sweet conceits my wits did entertain
ere beauty's force i knew or false delight
or to what oar she did her captives chain
led by a sacred troop of phoebus' train
i first began to read then lov'd to write
and so to praise a perfect red and white
but god wot wist not what was in my brain
love smil'd to see in what an awful guise
i turn'd those antiques of the age of gold
and that i might more mysteries behold
he set so fair a volume to mine eyes
that i quires clos'd which dead dead sighs but breathe
joy on this living book to read my death
i know that all beneath the moon decays
and what by mortals in this world is brought
in time's great periods shall return to nought
that fairest states have fatal nights and days
i know how all the muse's heavenly lays
with toil of spright which are so dearly bought
as idle sounds of few or none are sought
and that nought lighter is than airy praise
i know frail beauty like the purple flower
to which one morn oft birth and death affords
that love a jarring is of minds' accords
where sense and will invassal reason's power
know what i list this all can not me move
but that o me i both must write and love
ye who so curiously do paint your thoughts
enlight'ning ev'ry line in such a guise
that they seem rather to have fall'n from skies
than of a human hand be mortal draughts
in one part sorrow so tormented lies
as if his life at ev'ry sigh would part
love here blindfolded stands with bow and dart
there hope looks pale despair with rainy eyes
of my rude pencil look not for such art
my wit i find now lessened to devise
so high conceptions to express my smart
and some think love but feign'd if too too wise
these troubled words and lines confus'd you find
are like unto their model my sick mind
fair is my yoke though grievous be my pains
sweet are my wounds although they deeply smart
my bit is gold though shortened be the reins
my bondage brave though i may not depart
although i burn the fire which doth impart
those flames so sweet reviving force contains
that like arabia's bird my wasted heart
made quick by death more lively still remains
i joy though oft my waking eyes spend tears
i never want delight even when i groan
best companied when most i am alone
a heaven of hopes i have midst hells of fears
thus every way contentment strange i find
but most in her rare beauty my rare mind
how that vast heaven inttled first is roll'd
if any other worlds beyond it lie
and people living in eternity
or essence pure that doth this all uphold
what motion have those fixed sparks of gold
the wand'ring carbuncles which shine from high
by sprights or bodies contrare ways in sky
if they be turn'd and mortal things behold
how sun posts heaven about how night's pale queen
with borrowed beams looks on this hanging round
what cause fair iris hath and monsters seen
in air's large fields of light and seas profound
did hold my wand'ring thoughts when thy sweet eye
bade me leave all and only think on thee
vaunt not fair heavens of your two glorious lights
which though most bright yet see not when they shine
and shining cannot show their beams divine
both in one place but part by days and nights
earth vaunt not of those treasures ye enshrine
held only dear because hid from our sights
your pure and burnish'd gold your diamonds fine
snow passing ivory that the eye delights
nor seas of those dear wares are in you found
vaunt not rich pearl red coral which do stir
a fond desire in fools to plunge your ground
those all more fair are to be had in her
pearl ivory coral diamond suns gold
teeth neck lips heart eyes hair are to behold
that learned grecian who did so excel
in knowledge passing sense that he is nam'd
of all the after worlds divine doth tell
that at the time when first our souls are fram'd
ere in these mansions blind they come to dwell
they live bright rays of that eternal light
and others see know love in heaven's great height
not toil'd with aught to reason doth rebel
most true it is for straight at the first sight
my mind me told that in some other place
it elsewhere saw the idea of that face
and lov'd a love of heavenly pure delight
no wonder now i feel so fair a flame
sith i her lov'd ere on this earth she came
now while the night her sable veil hath spread
and silently her resty coach doth roll
rousing with her from tethys' azure bed
those starry nymphs which dance about the pole
while cynthia in purest cypress clad
the latmian shepherd in a trance descries
and whiles looks pale from height of all the skies
whiles dyes her beauties in a bashful red
while sleep in triumph closed hath all eyes
and birds and beasts a silence sweet do keep
and proteus' monstrous people in the deep
the winds and waves husht up to rest entice
i wake muse weep and who my heart hath slain
see still before me to augment my pain
sleep silence' child sweet father of soft rest
prince whose approach peace to all mortals brings
indifferent host to shepherds and to kings
sole comforter of minds with grief opprest
lo by thy charming rod all breathing things
lie slumb'ring with forgetfulness possest
and yet o'er me to spread thy drowsy wings
thou spares alas who cannot be thy guest
since i am thine o come but with that face
to inward light which thou art wont to show
with feigned solace ease a true felt woe
or if deaf god thou do deny that grace
come as thou wilt and what thou wilt bequeath
i long to kiss the image of my death
fair moon who with thy cold and silver shine
makes sweet the horror of the dreadful night
delighting the weak eye with smiles divine
which phoebus dazzles with his too much light
bright queen of the first heaven if in thy shrine
by turning oft and heaven's eternal might
thou hast not yet that once sweet fire of thine
endymion forgot and lover's plight
if cause like thine may pity breed in thee
and pity somewhat else to it obtain
since thou hast power of dreams as well as he
who paints strange figures in the slumb'ring brain
now while she sleeps in doleful guise her show
these tears and the black map of all my woe
lamp of heaven's crystal hall that brings the hours
eye dazzler who makes the ugly night
at thine approach fly to her slumb'ry bow'rs
and fills the world with wonder and delight
life of all lives death giver by thy flight
to southern pole from these six signs of ours
goldsmith of all the stars with silver bright
who moon enamels apelles of the flow'rs
ah from those watery plains thy golden head
raise up and bring the so long lingering morn
a grave nay hell i find become this bed
this bed so grievously where i am torn
but woe is me though thou now brought the day
day shall but serve more sorrow to display
ah burning thoughts now let me take some rest
and your tumultuous broils a while appease
is 't not enough stars fortune love molest
me all at once but ye must too displease
let hope though false yet lodge within my breast
my high attempt though dangerous yet praise
what though i trace not right heaven's steepy ways
it doth suffice my fall shall make me blest
i do not doat on days nor fear not death
so that my life be brave what though not long
let me renown'd live from the vulgar throng
and when ye list heavens take this borrowed breath
men but like visions are time all doth claim
he lives who dies to win a lasting name
o sacred blush impurpling cheeks' pure skies
with crimson wings which spread thee like the morn
o bashful look sent from those shining eyes
which though cast down on earth couldst heaven adorn
o tongue in which most luscious nectar lies
that can at once both bless and make forlorn
dear coral lip which beauty beautifies
that trembling stood ere that her words were born
and you her words words no but golden chains
which did captive mine ears ensnare my soul
wise image of her mind mind that contains
a power all power of senses to control
ye all from love dissuade so sweetly me
that i love more if more my love could be
nor arne nor mincius nor stately tiber
sebethus nor the flood into whose streams
he fell who burnt the world with borrow'd beams
gold rolling tagus munda famous iber
sorgue rhone loire garron nor proud banked seine
peneus phasis xanthus humble ladon
nor she whose nymphs excel her who lov'd adon
fair tamesis nor ister large nor rhine
euphrates tigris indus hermus gange
pearly hydaspes serpent like meander
the gulf bereft sweet hero her leander
nile that far his hidden head doth range
have ever had so rare a cause of praise
as ora where this northern phoenix stays
to hear my plaints fair river crystalline
thou in a silent slumber seems to stay
delicious flow'rs lily and columbine
ye bow your heads when i my woes display
forests in you the myrtle palm and bay
have had compassion list'ning to my groans
the winds with sighs have solemniz'd my moans
'mong leaves which whispered what they could not say
the caves the rocks the hills the sylvans' thrones
as if even pity did in them appear
have at my sorrows rent their ruthless stones
each thing i find hath sense except my dear
who doth not think i love or will not know
my grief perchance delighting in my woe
sweet brook in whose clear crystal i mine eyes
have oft seen great in labour of their tears
enamell'd bank whose shining gravel bears
these sad characters of my miseries
high woods whose mounting tops menace the spheres
wild citizens amphions of the trees
you gloomy groves at hottest noons which freeze
elysian shades which phoebus never clears
vast solitary mountains pleasant plains
embroid'red meads that ocean ways you reach
hills dales springs all that my sad cry constrains
to take part of my plaints and learn woe's speech
will that remorseless fair e'er pity show
of grace now answer if ye ought know no
with flaming horns the bull now brings the year
melt do the horrid mountains' helms of snow
the silver floods in pearly channels flow
the late bare woods green anadems do wear
the nightingale forgetting winter's woe
calls up the lazy morn her notes to hear
those flow'rs are spread which names of princes bear
some red some azure white and golden grow
here lows a heifer there bea wailing strays
a harmless lamb not far a stag rebounds
the shepherds sing to grazing flocks sweet lays
and all about the echoing air resounds
hills dales woods floods and everything doth change
but she in rigour i in love am strange
when nature now had wonderfully wrought
all auristella's parts except her eyes
to make those twins two lamps in beauty's skies
she counsel of her starry senate sought
mars and apollo first did her advise
in colour black to wrap those comets bright
that love him so might soberly disguise
and unperceived wound at every sight
chaste phoebe spake for purest azure dyes
but jove and venus green about the light
to frame thought best as brigging most delight
that to pin'd hearts hope might for aye arise
nature all said a paradise of green
there plac'd to make all love which have them seen
in vain i haunt the cold and silver springs
to quench the fever burning in my veins
in vain love's pilgrim mountains dales and plains
i overrun vain help long absence brings
in vain my friends your counsel me constrains
to fly and place my thoughts on other things
ah like the bird that fired hath her wings
the more i move the greater are my pains
desire alas desire a zeuxis new
from indies borrowing gold from western skies
most bright cynoper sets before mine eyes
in every place her hair sweet look and hue
that fly run rest i all doth prove but vain
my life lies in those looks which have me slain
all other beauties howsoe'er they shine
in hairs more bright than is the golden ore
or cheeks more fair than fairest eglantine
or hands like hers who comes the sun before
match'd with that heavenly hue and shape divine
with those dear stars which my weak thoughts adore
look but like shadows or if they be more
it is in that that they are like to thine
who sees those eyes their force and doth not prove
who gazeth on the dimple of that chin
and finds not venus' son intrench'd therein
or hath not sense or knows not what is love
to see thee had narcissus had the grace
he sure had died with wond'ring on thy face
my tears may well numidian lions tame
and pity breed into the hardest heart
that ever pyrrha did to maid impart
when she them first of blushing rocks did frame
ah eyes which only serve to wail my smart
how long will you mine inward woes proclaim
let it suffice you bear a weeping part
all night at day though ye do not the same
cease idle sighs to spend your storms in vain
and these calm secret shades more to molest
contain you in the prison of my breast
you do not ease but aggravate my pain
or if burst forth you must that tempest move
in sight of her whom i so dearly love
nymphs sister nymphs which haunt this crystal brook
and happy in these floating bowers abide
where trembling roofs of trees from sun you hide
which make ideal woods in every crook
whether ye garlands for your locks provide
or pearly letters seek in sandy hook
or count your loves when thetis was a bride
lift up your golden heads and on me look
read in mine eyes mine agonising cares
and what ye read recount to her again
fair nymphs say all these streams are but my tears
and if she ask you how they sweet remain
tell that the bitterest tears which eyes can pour
when shed for her do cease more to be sour
then is she gone o fool and coward i
o good occasion lost ne'er to be found
what fatal chains have my dull senses bound
when best they may that they not fortune try
here is the flow'ry bed where she did lie
with roses here she stellified the ground
she fix'd her eyes on this yet smiling pond
nor time nor courteous place seem'd ought deny
too long too long respect i do embrace
your counsel full of threats and sharp disdain
disdain in her sweet heart can have no place
and though come there must straight retire again
henceforth respect farewell i oft hear told
who lives in love can never be too bold
in mind's pure glass when i myself behold
and vively see how my best days are spent
what clouds of care above my head are roll'd
what coming harms which i can not prevent
my begun course i wearied do repent
and would embrace what reason oft hath told
but scarce thus think i when love hath controll'd
all the best reasons reason could invent
though sure i know my labour's end is grief
the more i strive that i the more shall pine
that only death can be my last relief
yet when i think upon that face divine
like one with arrow shot in laughter's place
malgreacute my heart i joy in my disgrace
dear quirister who from those shadows sends
ere that the blushing dawn dare show her light
such sad lamenting strains that night attends
become all ear stars stay to hear thy plight
if one whose grief even reach of thought transcends
who ne'er not in a dream did taste delight
may thee importune who like case pretends
and seems to joy in woe in woe's despite
tell me so may thou fortune milder try
and long long sing for what thou thus complains
sith winter gone the sun in dappled sky
now smiles on meadows mountains woods and plains
the bird as if my questions did her move
with trembling wings sobb'd forth i love i love
trust not sweet soul those curled waves of gold
with gentle tides which on your temples flow
nor temples spread with flakes of virgin snow
nor snow of cheeks with tyrian grain enroll'd
trust not those shining lights which wrought my woe
when first i did their burning rays behold
nor voice whose sounds more strange effects do show
than of the thracian harper have been told
look to this dying lily fading rose
dark hyacinth of late whose blushing beams
made all the neighbouring herbs and grass rejoice
and think how little is 'twixt life's extremes
the cruel tyrant that did kill those flow'rs
shall once ay me not spare that spring of yours
that i so slenderly set forth my mind
writing i wot not what in ragged rhymes
and charg'd with brass into these golden times
when others tower so high am left behind
i crave not phoebus leave his sacred cell
to bind my brows with fresh aonian bays
let them have that who tuning sweetest lays
by tempe sit or aganippe's well
nor yet to venus' tree do i aspire
sith she for whom i might affect that praise
my best attempts with cruel words gainsays
and i seek not that others me admire
of weeping myrrh the crown is which i crave
with a sad cypress to adorn my grave
sound hoarse sad lute true witness of my woe
and strive no more to ease self chosen pain
with soul enchanting sounds your accents strain
unto these tears incessantly which flow
shrill treble weep and you dull basses show
your master's sorrow in a deadly vein
let never joyful hand upon you go
nor consort keep but when you do complain
fly phoebus' rays nay hate the irksome light
woods' solitary shades for thee are best
or the black horrors of the blackest night
when all the world save thou and i doth rest
then sound sad lute and bear a mourning part
thou hell mayst move though not a woman's heart
you restless seas appease your roaring waves
and you who raise huge mountains in that plain
air's trumpeters your blust'ring storms restrain
and listen to the plaints my grief doth cause
eternal lights though adamantine laws
of destinies to move still you ordain
turn hitherward your eyes your axe tree pause
and wonder at the torments i sustain
earth if thou be not dull'd by my disgrace
and senseless made now ask those powers above
why they so crost a wretch brought on thy face
fram'd for mishap th' anachorite of love
and bid them if they would more aeligtnas burn
in rhodope or erymanthe me turn
what cruel star into this world me brought
what gloomy day did dawn to give me light
what unkind hand to nurse me orphan sought
and would not leave me in eternal night
what thing so dear as i hath essence bought
the elements dry humid heavy light
the smallest living things by nature wrought
be freed of woe if they have small delight
ah only i abandon'd to despair
nail'd to my torments in pale horror's shade
like wand'ring clouds see all my comforts fled
and evil on evil with hours my life impair
the heaven and fortune which were wont to turn
fixt in one mansion stay to cause me mourn
dear eye which deign'st on this sad monument
the sable scroll of my mishaps to view
though with the mourning muses' tears besprent
and darkly drawn which is not feign'd but true
if thou not dazzled with a heavenly hue
and comely feature didst not yet lament
but happy liv'st unto thyself content
o let not love thee to his laws subdue
look on the woful shipwreck of my youth
and let my ruins for a phare thee serve
to shun this rock capharean of untruth
and serve no god who doth his churchmen starve
his kingdom is but plaints his guerdon tears
what he gives more are jealousies and fears
if crost with all mishaps be my poor life
if one short day i never spent in mirth
if my spright with itself holds lasting strife
if sorrow's death is but new sorrow's birth
if this vain world be but a sable stage
where slave born man plays to the scoffing stars
if youth be toss'd with love with weakness age
if knowledge serve to hold our thoughts in wars
if time can close the hundred mouths of fame
and make what long since past like that to be
if virtue only be an idle name
if i when i was born was born to die
why seek i to prolong these loathsome days
the fairest rose in shortest time decays
let fortune triumph now and iouml sing
sith i must fall beneath this load of care
let her what most i prize of ev'ry thing
now wicked trophies in her temple rear
she who high palmy empires doth not spare
and tramples in the dust the proudest king
let her vaunt how my bliss she did impair
to what low ebb she now my flow doth bring
let her count how a new ixion me
she in her wheel did turn how high nor low
i never stood but more to tortur'd be
weep soul weep plaintful soul thy sorrows know
weep of thy tears till a black river swell
which may cocytus be to this thy hell
o cruel beauty meekness inhumane
that night and day contend with my desire
and seek my hope to kill not quench my fire
by death not balm to ease my pleasant pain
though ye my thoughts tread down which would aspire
and bound my bliss do not alas disdain
that i your matchless worth and grace admire
and for their cause these torments sharp sustain
let great empedocles vaunt of his death
found in the midst of those sicilian flames
and phaeumlthon that heaven him reft of breath
and daeligdal's son he nam'd the samian streams
their haps i envy not my praise shall be
the fairest she that liv'd gave death to me
the hyperborean hills ceraunus' snow
or arimaspus cruel first thee bred
the caspian tigers with their milk thee fed
and fauns did human blood on thee bestow
fierce orithyia's lover in thy bed
thee lull'd asleep where he enrag'd doth blow
thou didst not drink the floods which here do flow
but tears or those by icy tanais' head
sith thou disdains my love neglects my grief
laughs at my groans and still affects my death
of thee nor heaven i'll seek no more relief
nor longer entertain this loathsome breath
but yield unto my star that thou mayst prove
what loss thou hadst in losing such a love
who hath not seen into her saffron bed
the morning's goddess mildly her repose
or her of whose pure blood first sprang the rose
lull'd in a slumber by a myrtle shade
who hath not seen that sleeping white and red
makes phoebe look so pale which she did close
in that ionian hill to ease her woes
which only lives by nectar kisses fed
come but and see my lady sweetly sleep
the sighing rubies of those heavenly lips
the cupids which breast's golden apples keep
those eyes which shine in midst of their eclipse
and he them all shall see perhaps and prove
she waking but persuades now forceth love
of cytherea's birds that milk white pair
on yonder leafy myrtle tree which groan
and waken with their kisses in the air
enamour'd zephyrs murmuring one by one
if thou but sense hadst like pygmalion's stone
or hadst not seen medusa's snaky hair
love's lessons thou might'st learn and learn sweet fair
to summer's heat ere that thy spring be grown
and if those kissing lovers seem but cold
look how that elm this ivy doth embrace
and binds and clasps with many a wanton fold
and courting sleep o'ershadows all the place
nay seems to say dear tree we shall not part
in sign whereof lo in each leaf a heart
the sun is fair when he with crimson crown
and flaming rubies leaves his eastern bed
fair is thaumantias in her crystal gown
when clouds engemm'd hang azure green and red
to western worlds when wearied day goes down
and from heaven's windows each star shows her head
earth's silent daughter night is fair though brown
fair is the moon though in love's livery clad
fair chloris is when she doth paint april
fair are the meads the woods the floods are fair
fair looketh ceres with her yellow hair
and apples' queen when rose cheek'd she doth smile
that heaven and earth and seas are fair is true
yet true that all not please so much as you
slide soft fair forth and make a crystal plain
cut your white locks and on your foamy face
let not a wrinkle be when you embrace
the boat that earth's perfections doth contain
winds wonder and through wond'ring hold your peace
or if that ye your hearts cannot restrain
from sending sighs mov'd by a lover's case
sigh and in her fair hair yourselves enchain
or take these sighs which absence makes arise
from mine oppressed breast and wave the sails
or some sweet breath new brought from paradise
floods seem to smile love o'er the winds prevails
and yet huge waves arise the cause is this
the ocean strives with forth the boat to kiss
ah who can see those fruits of paradise
celestial cherries which so sweetly swell
that sweetness' self confined there seems to dwell
and all those sweetest parts about despise
ah who can see and feel no flame surprise
his hardened heart for me alas too well
i know their force and how they do excel
now burn i through desire now do i freeze
i die dear life unless to me be given
as many kisses as the spring hath flow'rs
or as the silver drops of iris' show'rs
or as the stars in all embracing heaven
and if displeas'd ye of the match complain
ye shall have leave to take them back again
is't not enough ay me me thus to see
like some heaven banish'd ghost still wailing go
a shadow which your rays do only show
to vex me more unless ye bid me die
what could ye worse allot unto your foe
but die will i so ye will not deny
that grace to me which mortal foes even try
to choose what sort of death should end my woe
one time i found whenas ye did me kiss
ye gave my panting soul so sweet a touch
that half i swoon'd in midst of all my bliss
i do but crave my death's wound may be such
for though by grief i die not and annoy
is't not enough to die through too much joy
she whose fair flow'rs no autumn makes decay
whose hue ceestial earthly hues doth stain
into a pleasant odoriferous plain
did walk alone to brave the pride of may
and whilst through checker'd lists she made her way
which smil'd about her sight to entertain
lo unawares where love did bid remain
she spied and sought to make of him her prey
for which of golden locks a fairest hair
to bind the boy she took but he afraid
at her approach sprang swiftly in the air
and mounting far from reach look'd back and said
why shouldst thou sweet me seek in chains to bind
sith in thine eyes i daily am confin'd
dear wood and you sweet solitary place
where from the vulgar i estranged live
contented more with what your shades me give
than if i had what thetis doth embrace
what snaky eye grown jealous of my peace
now from your silent horrors would me drive
when sun progressing in his glorious race
beyond the twins doth near our pole arrive
what sweet delight a quiet life affords
and what it is to be of bondage free
far from the madding worldling's hoarse discords
sweet flow'ry place i first did learn of thee
ah i if i were mine own your dear resorts
i would not change with princes' stately courts
thou window once which served for a sphere
to that dear planet of my heart whose light
made often blush the glorious queen of night
while she in thee more beauteous did appear
what mourning weeds alas now dost thou wear
how loathsome to mine eyes is thy sad sight
how poorly look'st thou with what heavy cheer
since that sun set which made thee shine so bright
unhappy now thee close for as of late
to wond'ring eyes thou wast a paradise
bereft of her who made thee fortunate
a gulf thou art whence clouds of sighs arise
but unto none so noisome as to me
who hourly see my murder'd joys in thee
are these the flow'ry banks is this the mead
where she was wont to pass the pleasant hours
did here her eyes exhale mine eyes' salt show'rs
when on her lap i laid my weary head
is this the goodly elm did us o'erspread
whose tender rind cut out in curious flow'rs
by that white hand contains those flames of ours
is this the rustling spring us music made
deflourish'd mead where is your heavenly hue
bank where that arras did you late adorn
how look ye elm all withered and forlorn
only sweet spring nought altered seems in you
but while here chang'd each other thing appears
to sour your streams take of mine eyes these tears
alexis here she stay'd among these pines
sweet hermitress she did alone repair
here did she spread the treasure of her hair
more rich than that brought from the colchian mines
she set her by these musked eglantines
the happy place the print seems yet to bear
her voice did sweeten here thy sugar'd lines
to which winds trees beasts birds did lend their ear
me here she first perceiv'd and here a morn
of bright carnations did o'erspread her face
here did she sigh here first my hopes were born
and i first got a pledge of promis'd grace
but ah what serv'd it to be happy so
sith passed pleasures double but new woe
o night clear night o dark and gloomy day
o woful waking o soul pleasing sleep
o sweet conceits which in my brains did creep
yet sour conceits which went so soon away
a sleep i had more than poor words can say
for clos'd in arms methought i did thee keep
a sorry wretch plung'd in misfortunes deep
am i not wak'd when light doth lies bewray
o that that night had ever still been black
o that that day had never yet begun
and you mine eyes would ye no time saw sun
to have your sun in such a zodiac
lo what is good of life is but a dream
when sorrow is a never ebbing stream
hair precious hair which midas' hand did strain
part of the wreath of gold that crowns those brows
which winter's whitest white in whiteness stain
and lily by eridan's bank that grows
hair fatal present which first caus'd my woes
when loose ye hang like danae's golden rain
sweet nets which sweetly do all hearts enchain
strings deadly strings with which love bends his bows
how are ye hither come tell me o hair
dear armelet for what thus were ye given
i know a badge of bondage i you wear
yet hair for you o that i were a heaven
like berenice's lock that ye might shine
but brighter far about this arm of mine
with grief in heart and tears in swooning eyes
when i to her had giv'n a sad farewell
close sealed with a kiss and dew which fell
on my else moisten'd face from beauty's skies
so strange amazement did my mind surprise
that at each pace i fainting turn'd again
like one whom a torpedo stupefies
not feeling honour's bit nor reason's rein
but when fierce stars to part me did constrain
with back cast looks i envied both and bless'd
the happy walls and place did her contain
till that sight's shafts their flying object miss'd
so wailing parted ganymede the fair
when eagles' talons bare him through the air
how many times night's silent queen her face
hath hid how oft with stars in silver mask
in heaven's great hall she hath begun her task
and cheer'd the waking eye in lower place
how oft the sun hath made by heaven's swift race
the happy lover to forsake the breast
of his dear lady wishing in the west
his golden coach to run had larger space
i ever count and number since alas
i bade farewell to my heart's dearest guest
the miles i compass and in mind i chase
the floods and mountains hold me from my rest
but woe is me long count and count may i
ere i see her whose absence makes me die
so grievous is my pain so painful life
that oft i find me in the arms of death
but breath half gone that tyrant called death
who others kills restoreth me to life
for while i think how woe shall end with life
and that i quiet peace shall joy by death
that thought even doth o'erpower the pains of death
and call me home again to loathed life
thus doth mine evil transcend both life and death
while no death is so bad as is my life
nor no life such which doth not end by death
and protean changes turn my death and life
o happy those who in their birth find death
sith but to languish heaven affordeth life
fame who with golden pens abroad dost range
where phoebus leaves the night and brings the day
fame in one place who restless dost not stay
till thou hast flown from atlas unto gange
fame enemy to time that still doth change
and in his changing course would make decay
what here below he findeth in his way
even making virtue to herself look strange
daughter of heaven now all thy trumpets sound
raise up thy head unto the highest sky
with wonder blaze the gifts in her are found
and when she from this mortal globe shall fly
in thy wide mouth keep long long keep her name
so thou by her she by thee live shall fame
i curse the night yet do from day me hide
the pandionian birds i tire with moans
the echoes even are wearied with my groans
since absence did me from my bliss divide
each dream each toy my reason doth affright
and when remembrance reads the curious scroll
of pass'd contentments caused by her sight
then bitter anguish doth invade my soul
while thus i live eclipsed of her light
o me what better am i than the mole
or those whose zenith is the only pole
whose hemisphere is hid with so long night
save that in earth he rests they hope for sun
i pine and find mine endless night begun
of death some tell some of the cruel pain
which that bad craftsman in his work did try
when a new monster flames once did constrain
a human corpse to yield a brutish cry
some tell of those in burning beds who lie
for that they durst in the phlegraelign plain
the mighty rulers of the sky defy
and siege those crystal towers which all contain
another counts of phlegethon's hot floods
the souls which drink ixion's endless smart
and his to whom a vulture eats the heart
one tells of spectres in enchanted woods
of all those pains he who the worst would prove
let him be absent and but pine in love
place me where angry titan burns the moor
and thirsty afric fiery monsters brings
or where the new born phoenix spreads her wings
and troops of wond'ring birds her flight adore
place me by gange or ind's empamper'd shore
where smiling heavens on earth cause double springs
place me where neptune's quire of syrens sings
or where made hoarse through cold he leaves to roar
me place where fortune doth her darlings crown
a wonder or a spark in envy's eye
or let outrageous fates upon me frown
and pity wailing see disaster'd me
affection's print my mind so deep doth prove
i may forget myself but not my love
of mortal glory o soon darken'd ray
o posting joys of man more swift than wind
o fond desires which wing'd with fancies stray
o trait'rous hopes which do our judgments blind
lo in a flash that light is gone away
which dazzle did each eye delight each mind
and with that sun from whence it came combin'd
now makes more radiant heaven's eternal day
let beauty now bedew her cheeks with tears
let widow'd music only roar and plain
poor virtue get thee wings and mount the spheres
and let thine only name on earth remain
death hath thy temple raz'd love's empire foil'd
the world of honour worth and sweetness spoil'd
those eyes those sparkling sapphires of delight
which thousand thousand hearts did set on fire
which made that eye of heaven that brings the light
oft jealous stay amaz'd them to admire
that living snow those crimson roses bright
those pearls those rubies which did breed desire
those locks of gold that purple fair of tyre
are wrapt ay me up in eternal night
what hast thou more to vaunt of wretched world
sith she who cursed thee made blest is gone
thine ever burning lamps rounds ever whirl'd
can unto thee not model such a one
for if they would such beauty bring on earth
they should be forc'd again to make her breath
o fate conspir'd to pour your worst on me
o rigorous rigour which doth all confound
with cruel hands ye have cut down the tree
and fruit and flower dispersed on the ground
a little space of earth my love doth bound
that beauty which did raise it to the sky
turn'd in neglected dust now low doth lie
deaf to my plaints and senseless of my wound
ah did i live for this ah did i love
for this and was it she did so excel
that ere she well life's sweet sour joys did prove
she should too dear a guest with horror dwell
weak influence of heaven what fair ye frame
falls in the prime and passeth like a dream
o woful life life no but living death
frail boat of crystal in a rocky sea
a sport expos'd to fortune's stormy breath
which kept with pain with terror doth decay
the false delights true woes thou dost bequeath
mine all appalled mind do so affray
that i those envy who are laid in earth
and pity them that run thy dreadful way
when did mine eyes behold one cheerful morn
when had my tossed soul one night of rest
when did not hateful stars my projects scorn
o now i find for mortals what is best
even sith our voyage shameful is and short
soon to strike sail and perish in the port
mine eyes dissolve your globes in briny streams
and with a cloud of sorrow dim your sight
the sun's bright sun is set of late whose beams
gave lustre to your day day to your night
my voice now deafen earth with anathemes
roar forth a challenge in the world's despite
tell that disguised grief is her delight
that life a slumber is of fearful dreams
and woful mind abhor to think of joy
my senses all now comfortless you hide
accept no object but of black annoy
tears plaints sighs mourning weeds graves gaping wide
i have nought left to wish my hopes are dead
and all with her beneath a marble laid
my lute be as thou wert when thou didst grow
with thy green mother in some shady grove
when immelodious winds but made thee move
and birds their ramage did on the bestow
since that dear voice which did thy sounds approve
which wont in such harmonious strains to flow
is reft from earth to tune those spheres above
what art thou but a harbinger of woe
thy pleasing notes be pleasing notes no more
but orphans' wailings to the fainting ear
each stroke a sigh each sound draws forth a tear
for which be silint as in woods before
or if that any hand to touch thee deign
like widow'd turtle still her loss complain
ye hills of scotia by whose winding sides
the brawling stream of esk so swiftly flows
on whose wild banks a varied forest grows
and the birch vibrates as the current glides
while over your crags the rack incessant glides
athwart the steeps a moving mantle throws
or like that pillar vast majestic goes
which marshalled israel through egyptian tides
o take me to your calm retreats again
even in such scenes amid your gloom i find
a ray of pensive hope to cheer my mind
that heavenly mercies brighter hours ordain
for see though storms blacken the vale below
the auspicious bow on high in rich prismatic glow
yon silvery billows breaking on the beach
fall back in foam beneath the star shine clear
the while my rhymes are murmuring in your ear
a restless lore like that the billows teach
for on these sonnet waves my soul would reach
from its own depths and rest within you dear
as through the billowy voices yearning here
great nature strives to find a human speech
a sonnet is a wave of melody
from heaving waters of the impassion'd soul
a billow of tidal music one and whole
flows in the octave then returning free
its ebbing surges in the sestet roll
back to the deeps of life's tumultuous sea
i see thee pine like her in golden story
who in her prison woke and saw one day
the gates thrown open  saw the sunbeams play
with only a web 'tween her and summer's glory
who when that web  so frail so transitory
it broke before her breath  had fallen away
saw other webs and others rise for aye
which kept her prison'd till her hair was hoary
those songs half sung that yet were all divine
that woke romance the queen to reign afresh
had been but preludes from that lyre of thine
could thy rare spirit's wings have pierced the mesh
spun by the wizard who compels the flesh
but lets the poet see how heav'n can shine
the mirrored stars lit all the bulrush spears
and all the flags and broad leaved lily isles
the ripples shook the stars to golden smiles
then smoothed them back to happy golden spheres
we rowed  we sang her voice seemed in mine ears
an angel's yet with woman's dearest wiles
but shadows fell from gathering cloudy piles
and ripples shook the stars to fiery tears
god shaped the shadows like a phantom boat
where sate her soul and mine in doom's attire
along the lily isles i saw it float
where ripples shook the stars to symbols dire
we wept  we kissed while starry fingers wrote
and ripples shook the stars to a snake of fire
in her strange shadowy coronet she weareth
the faded jewels of an earlier time
an ancient sceptre in her hand she beareth
the purple of her robe is past its prime
through her thin silvery locks still dimly shineth
the flower wreath woven by pale memory's fingers
her heart is withered  yet it strangely shineth
in its lone urn a light that fitful lingers
with her low muffled voice of mystery
she reads old legends from time's mouldering pages
she telleth the present the recorded history
and change perpetual of bygone ages
her pilgrim feet still seek the haunted sod
once ours but now by naught but memory's footsteps trod
the boat is hauled upon the hardening sand
the mist is gathering o'er the dim morass
the kine are couching on the daisied grass
and in their stalls the champing horses stand
no plash of brine along the darkling strand
no light winds play the reed pipes as they pass
the moonlit deep is glittering like glass
and all things yield to stilly night's command
o balmy hours of silver sheen and dew
shall nought belie you save this labouring breast
the soul alone to nature be untrue
and still of what she hath not go in quest
just now ye spake ah speak those words anew
wait weary heart soon thou shalt also rest
the sad light sayeth how all autumn grieves
and how this rainy mist in heaven high
doth wake the sorrowings that deepest lie
behold the silent forms shorn of their leaves
the elm the maple and the antique oak
with gestures sorrowful they pray the sky
behold the rain pools where the brown leaves soak
and the same mournful branches mirrored lie
see how the sensuous mist cool smelling slips
like a wilful garment down from those wet limbs
which will be gracious to the singing lips
of the expected wind  for he will come
i hear him waken as the twilight dims
and my heart quickens and my words are dumb
the passions of a child attend his dreams
he lives loves hopes remembers is forlorn
for legendary creatures whom he deems
not too unreal  until one golden morn
the gracious all awaking sun shines in
upon his tranquil pillow and his eyes
are touched and opened greatly and begin
to drink reality with rich surprise
i loved the impetuous souls of ancient story
heroic characters kings queens whose wills
like empires rose achieved and fell in glory
i was a child  until the radiant dawn
thy beauty woke me o thy spirit fills
the stature of those heroes they are gone
when the enkindling spring upon the lea
was quenched with water and the rainy throng
of clouds perpetual had drowned her song
still thou didst lift thy heart and float to me
over the mist thy lonely melody
o swell again the throat and thrill the tongue
and rouse and ravish with thy passion young
the adoring air that drinks thine ecstasy
she hides her beauty in the wavy shroud
of april's swift and half translucent cloud
my love is lost in a more heavy shadow
my love is buried in the arms of grief
o send to her across the mourning meadow
that brighter sorrow thine  that music brief
the eastern hill hath scarce unveiled his head
and the deliberate sky hath but begun
to meditate upon a future sun
when thou dost rise from thy impatient bed
thy morning prayer unto the stars is said
and not unlike a child the penance done
of sleep thou goest to thy serious fun
exuberant  yet with a whisper tread
and when that lord doth to the world appear
the jovial sun he leans on his old hill
and levels forth to thee a golden smile
thee in his garden where each warming year
thou toilest in all joy with him to fill
and flood the soil with summer for a while
as the crag eagle to the zenith's height
wings his pursuit in his exalted hour
of her the tempest reared whose airy power
of plume and passion challengeth his flight
to that wild altitude where they unite
in mutual tumultuous victory
and the swift sting of natures ecstasy
their shuddering pinions and their skyward might
as they the strong to the full height of heaven
bear up that joy which to the strong is given
thus thus do we whose stormy spirits quiver
in the bold air of utter liberty
clash equal at our highest i and thee
unconquered and unconquering forever
in evil hour did pope's declining age
deceived and dazzled by the tinsel show
of wordy science and the nauseous flow
of mean officious flatteries engage
thy venal quill to deck his laboured page
with ribald nonsense and permit to strew
amidst his flowers the baleful weeds that grow
in the unblessed soil of rude and rancorous rage
yet this the avenging muse ordaineacuted so
when by his counsel or weak sufferance
to thee were trusted shakespeare's fame and fate
she doomed him down the stream of time to tow
thy foul dirt loaded hulk or sink perchance
dragged to oblivion by the foundering weight
o born in luckless hour with every muse
and every grace to foe what wayward fate
drives thee with fell and unrelenting hate
each choicest work of genius to abuse
sufficed it not with sacrilegious views
great shakespeare's awful shade to violate
and his fair paradise contaminate
whom impious lauder blushes to accuse
must pope thy friend mistaken hapless bard
to prove no sprig of laurel ever can grow
unblasted by thy venom must he groan
now daubed with flattery now by censure scarred
disguised deformed and made the public show
in motley weeds and colours not his own
o master of the heart whose magic skill
the close recesses of the soul can find
can rouse becalm and terrify the mind
now melt with pity now with anguish thrill
thy moral page while virtuous precepts fill
warm from the heart to mend the age designed
wit strength truth decency all conjoined
to lead our youth to good and guard from ill
o long enjoy what thou so well hast won
the grateful tribute of each honest heart
sincere nor hackneyed in the ways of men
at each distressful stroke their true tears run
and nature unsophisticate by art
owns and applauds the labours of thy pen
prelate whose steady hand and watchful eye
the sacred vessel of religion guide
secure from superstition's dangerous tide
and fateful rocks of infidelity
think not in this bad age of obloquy
when christian virtues christians dare deride
and worth by party zeal alone is tried
to escape the poisoned shafts of calumny
no  though the tenor of thy blameless life
like his whose flock is to thy care consigned
be spent in teaching truth and doing good
yet amongst the sons of bigotry and strife
thou too like him must hear thy good maligned
thy person slandered and thy truths withstood
capricious wray a sonnet needs must have
i ne'er was so put to 't before  a sonnet
why fourteen verses must be spent upon it
tis good howe'er t' have conquered the first stave
yet i shall ne'er find rhymes enough by half
said i and found myself i' the midst o' the second
if twice four verses were but fairly reckoned
i shall turn back on th' hardest part and laugh
thus far with good success i think i've scribbled
and of the twice seven lines have clean got o'er ten
courage another'll finish the first triplet
thanks to thee muse my work begins to shorten
there's thirteen lines got through driblet by driblet
'tis done count how you will i warr'nt there's fourteen
in the profound and dreadful calm of night
worn with the newness of my grief i come
dry eyed and fall beside you spent and dumb
dreading the dawn with all its aching light
dreading the day and all it holds for me
of restlessness and forms that come and go
new things to do new things to see and know
that were not yet when you were there to see
and shut my eyes and for a while pretend
that i can lean against you feel your hand
hear your heart beat and know you understand
though you are farther than the wide world's end
ah my beloveacuted swiftly silently
surely your kind kind ghost shall comfort me
it cannot be that you shall no more come
radiant with laughter holding hands for mine
seeking my soul for love's most earnest sign
meeting my thought with eloquent thought and dumb
it cannot be that i must look for you
there where the summer flames and find you not
of splendid sunsets know you all forgot
nor find you in the rain nor the sky's blue
for here the lily all her sweetness yields
and all my heart is open to the sun
and seeking peace in grief the long day done
i find it in the silver moonlit fields
then by the beauty of the world i know
that you are here and will not let me go
in these days every mother's son or daughter
writes verse which no one reads except the writer
although uninked the paper would be whiter
and worth per ream a hare when you have caught her
hundreds of unstaunched shelleys daily water
unanswering dust a thousand wordsworths scribble
and twice a thousand corn law rhymers dribble
rhymed prose unread  hymners of fraud and slaughter
by cant called other names alone find buyers
who buy but read not what a loss in paper
groans each immortal of the host of sighers
what profanation of the midnight taper
in expirations vile  but i write well
and wisely print why don't my poems sell
john  in the sound of that rebellious word
there is brave music  jack and jacobin
are vulgar terms law linked to shame and sin
they have a twang of jack the hangman's cord
yet john hath merit which can well afford
to be called jack's  by life's strange offs and ons
glory hath had great dealings with the johns
since history first awaked where fable snored
john cade john huss john hampden and john knox
ay these were the names of fellows who had will
john wilson's name far sounded sounds not ill
but how unlike john milton's or john locke's
john bright like locke and milton scorns paid sloth
and johnson might have liked to gibbet both
a hireling's wages to the priest are paid
while lives and dies in want and rags the bard
but preaching ought to be its own reward
and not a sordid if an honest trade
paul laboring proudly with his hands arrayed
regenerated hearts in peace and love
and when with power they preached the mystic dove
penn barclay clarkson asked not mammon's aid
as for its own sake poetry is sweet
to poets  so on tasks of mercy bound
religion travels with unsandaled feet
making the flinty desert holy ground
and never will her triumph be complete
while one paid pilgrim upon earth is found
gnarled oak and holly stone cropped like the stone
are ye of it or is it part of you
your union strange is marvellously true
and makes the granite which i stand upon
seem like the vision of an empire gone
gone yet still present though it never was
save as a shadow  let the shadow pass
so perish human glories every one
but rocks ye are not shadows trees ye cast
the almighty's shadow over the homeward bee
his name on brimham yea the coming blast
beneath his curtains reads it here with me
and pauses not to number marvels past
but speeds the thunder on over land and sea
why should the tiny harp be chained to themes
in fourteen lines with pedant rigour bound
the sonnet's might is mightier than it seems
witness the bard of eden lost and found
who gave this lute a clarion's battle sound
and lo another milton calmly turns
his eyes within a light that ever burns
waiting till wordsworth's second peer be found
meantime fitzadam's mournful music shows
that the scorned sonnet's charm may yet endear
some long deep strain or lay of well tolled woes
such as in byron's couplet brings a tear
to manly cheeks or over his stanza throws
rapture and grief solemnity and fear
toy of the titans  tiny harp again
i quarrel with the order of thy strings
established by the law of sonnet kings
and used by giants who do nought in vain
was petrarch then mistaken in the strain
that charms italia  were they tasteless things
that milton wrought  and are they mutterings
untuneful that pay wordsworth with pleased pain
no but i see that tyrants come of slaves
that states are won by rush of robbers' steel
and millions starved and tortured to their graves
because as they are taught men think and feel
therefore i change the sonnet's slavish notes
for cheaper music suited to my thoughts
abbey for ever smiling pensively
how like a thing of nature dost thou rise
amid her loveliest works as if the skies
clouded with grief were arched thy roof to be
and the tall trees were copied all from thee
mourning thy fortunes  while the waters dim
flow like the memory of thy evening hymn
beautiful in their sorrowing sympathy
as if they with a weeping sister wept
winds name thy name but thou though sad art calm
and time with thee his plighted troth hath kept
for harebells deck thy brow and at thy feet
where sleep the proud the bee and redbreast meet
mixing thy sighs with nature's lonely psalm
in life's dim mists of morning thou dost seem
to childhood's eyes a giant vague and vast
a shade across the dewy meadow cast
a blot upon the level darting beam
day comes apace and like a fearful dream
thou shrinkest and youth smiles deeming thee past
and manhood recks not of thee till at last
thou comest again a speck borne down the stream
larger thou growest and we see thee now
no foe but one whose silent plying wing
shall bear us from the swiftly fading shore
thou comest our head upon our breast we bow
and in our ears remembered voices ring
thy arms enfold us and we know no more
the mystic berry from the druid's tree
or limpet from the rock more easily
or ivy from its mated wall shall part
than man from whom he loves than heart from heart
oh the wild ecstasy the wildering pain
to bid adieu and know that ne'er again
the hand you hold the loving voice you hear
shall grasp your own on earth or charm your ear
the lingering clasp of the last fond embrace
the lingering gaze on the fast fading face
the faltering tongue the frozen memory
the stunning sense of lonely misery
ah who shall ever find the words to tell
the agony of those that take a last farewell
let be of mercy love let go the clasp
which yet has held thy beauty bound by me
a graceful bark beside a sombre quay
already now the waters sob and gasp
to dash and crush thee on me and to grasp
my tender treasure which by night and day
seen or unseen against me throbbing lay
near me thou diest love let go thy clasp
spread thy white bosomed sail unto the breeze
and i like one who waving farewells stands
and stretches arms whither arms cannot reach
must yearn to watch thee far upon the seas
at ebb across the weary level sands
at flood across the weary moaning beach
one moment night fold up thy wings again
and cast upon mine eyes the shadow of sleep
and in thy breath once more my senses steep
and draw once more thy clouds about my brain
whereon who looketh may forget his pain
for floating there even now my mistress bent
her lips towards me as on speech intent
for which my whole soul gasped as flowers for rain
then at the rustle of thy wings she fled
frighted and though with hope to stay her flight
i thrice called out she vanished out of sight
bid her return that so her speech be said
the day is up a voice is in the trees
and i am i and she is over seas
sweet singer who among thy poet's bays
some bitter fragrant herb has intertwined
who round about thy throbbing lyre dost bind
some scent which stealing with thy happiest lays
down to the heart's deep secret core doth raise
a subtle ache their sweetness cannot still
a yearning that they cannot all fulfil
that lives and sleeps and lives through many days
though restless youth and age unrested bring
their discontents though many things seem to lie
yet god be praised we cannot wholly die
whilst such as thou such as thy father sing
and point us still to such landmarks as these
monica obermann empedocles
the fierce sun smote him and went glorying down
and ere the gloaming died his spirit fled
the southern night burst into stars o'erhead
nor ruffled any wavelet to a frown
till morning from beneath her golden crown
smiled on the half mast ensign fluttering death
to beating pulses and to bated breath
as if her smile could smile men's sorrow down
slow tolls the bell the slow procession creeps
kind women's eyes are wet hard men's are grave
a voice commits our brother to the deeps
a plash divides the hollow gulfing wave
still plies the van still on the vessel speeds
nor ship nor sea nor sun our sorrow heeds
hush  hush it is the charm of nothingness
a sweet estate wherein there is no sweet
a music true though no vibrations beat
a passive mistress cold and passionless
bestowing not yet having power to bless
until in holy love we kiss her feet
o joy wherein no soul a friend may greet
o thou that giv'st no comfort in distress
why do we love thee silence art thou then
the mystic ghostly mother of mankind
from forth whose womb we sprang without a throe
to thee resort for rest and peace all men
in thy embrace serene pure joy they find
art thou the very heaven whereto we go
with this as little as it seems can one
work wonders build up cities plough the waste
alter customs and laws and change the taste
of nations set up thrones and pluck them down
what privilege then claims it as its own
or what strange subjects neath its sway are placed
that thus with a few strokes can be effaced
things grey as time familiar as the sun
men's thoughts these move all act but on the thought
and will of man and then the lever by
which mightiest revolutions have been wrought
is in thy one weak hand lost to man's eye
perhaps like god by few or known or sought
those with two fingers movest the world's machinery
the sun is burning with intensest light
behind yon grove and in the golden glow
of unconsuming fire it doth show
like to the bush in which to moses' sight
the lord appeared and o am i not right
in thinking that he reappears e'en now
to me in the old glory and i bow
my head in wonder hush'd before his might
yea this whole world so vast to faith's clear eye
is but that burning bush full of his power
his light and glory not consumed thereby
but made transparent till in each least flower
yea in each smallest leaf she can descry
his spirit shining through it visibly
silence broods o'er the mighty babylon
and darkness his twin brother with him keeps
his solemn watch the wearied city sleeps
and solitude strange contrast muses on
the fate of man there whence the crowd anon
will scare her with life's tumult the great deeps
of human thought are stirless yet there creeps
as 'twere a far off hum scarce heard then gone
on the still air 'tis the great heart doth move
and beat at intervals soon from its sleep
to start refreshed oh thou who rul'st above
be with it in its dreams and let it keep
awake the spirit of pure peace and love
which thou breath'st through it now so still and deep
the golden foot prints of departing day
are fading from the ocean silently
and twilight stealing onward halves the sky
one after one they fade in light away
while with a thousand songs the earth doth say
farewell uplifting all her mountains high
to catch the last reflections ere they die
as one by one their peaks grow cold and grey
yon orb that hangs upon the ocean's rim
looks janus like both back and forward too
and while it fades here to earth's evening hymn
it brightens from afar o'er regions new
unto the songs of morning raised to him
who thus 'twixt night and day the great line drew
sweet flower thou art a link of memory
an emblem to the heart of bright days flown
and in thy silence too there is a tone
that stirs the inmost soul more potently
than if a trumpet's voice had rent the sky
i love thee much for when i stray alone
stealing from nature her calm thoughts which own
no self disturbance and my curious eye
catches thy magic glance methinks a spell
has touched my soul once more i grow a boy
once more my thoughts that as a passing bell
seemed to toll o'er departed shapes of joy
change to old chimes and in my bosom swell
fresh pulses of a bliss without alloy
in this strait waistcoat of poor fourteen lines
our shakspear cramped his mighty intellect
'tis as if ocean should confines elect
like tributary streams golconda's mines
contract their splendours to one gem that shines
with fraction'd lustre or great kings reject
th'imperious sceptre and instead select
the pastoral crook but genius all refines
he in that circumscription still could move
a chartered libertine and spirits raise
by his so potent art all rules above
in that small charmed circle to the rays
of his fine wit it did a focus prove
a wheel whose rondure close confine doth brace
o lame and impotent conclusion 'tis
as some full stream should run not to the sea
but lose itself in sand or stagnant be
or proud steed his last winning leap should miss
and fall flat t'other side or lovers kiss
and with their last word quarrel or the bee
taint all the honey by the flower he
last sucked from or dove's coo end with snake's hiss
'tis like adonis with a cloven foot
fair woman fish like ending richest vein
of gold at fault coarse patch in rarest suit
mere discord in last notes of voice or strain
angelic    strange all these that he should do it
who wrote what went before more strange again
poor thought stretched on rime's procrustean bed
and threatened saving that it doth not kill
outright with every mortal ache and ill
by thought thought in the flesh inherited
clothed on with words its mortal weeds first head
and neck must crane and stretch then feet until
of prescribed length or lopped sometimes with skill
surgeonly oftener hacked till well nigh dead
so liest thou on the rack body and soul
at odds in dread of rimed death who waits
at every turn and mocks each twist and roll
while words unsesquipedalian curse thy fates
now 'tis thy racked brain can't the thought control
now thy lame feet won't go curs'd in both states
take not poetic souls a word amiss
i mean the unweaned spirits of the age
male female epicoene  'tis all the rage
to write the gentler sex all licensed kiss
the muse's hands one serving that one this
in lyric ode song pastoral on the stage
in sock or buskin  lively sad gay sage
strings of its own their lyre has which his
proud man's still lacks when many sequent rimes
as in the sonnet most offend the ear
or please as jangled or well rung the chimes
with bells each under other answering clear
ring ye caesural pauses rhythmic times
following sure lead well chosen pioneer
off ye mastodons megalosauroi vast
and monstrous nature's ruder tentatives
her clumsier essays of which nought survives
but fossil bones  dread nightmares of the past
which her less skilful hand in rude moulds cast
then brake them as a 'prentice tries and strives
until the cunning of his hand arrives
at full perfection forms matured to last
off to dark night and chaos  and instead
come thou true creature of intelligence
warm blooded on promethean fire fed
born of man's brain partaking of his sense
by science out of civilisation bred
mightier than these whom thou would'st drive from hence
were all these means and rich appliances
meant merely to enable man to make
more money not for the diviner sake
of his immortal being that through these
it might enlarge with spiritual increase
then could i wish that ye might ever wake
and watch and mammon's wages only take
and make but gold who for it mar your peace
these things were meant to give man's soul more time
to look about it and unto the heights
of spiritual being oftener climb
to bring with the reach of all delights
confined yet to the few and give sublime
direction to the spirit's daily flight
the narrow senses over ride man's mind
and into circumscription put his thought
tie up the wings of th'imagination caught
and birdlimed by the shows of things confined
strike flat the earth's rotundity and bind
him down with countless threads by custom wrought
like gulliver by lilliputians caught
that seeing he sees not or but purblind
our senses serve us well but when as here
they have no correspondence with true sight
'tis like blind leading blind  far o'er the clear
calm sea a vessel's topmasts thought invite
and the grand mirror convex doth appear
not flat  thus science may set nature right
o science  proud iconoclast thy way
is strewed with fragments of our reverence
and love  idols with small or no pretence
right oft upon their pedestals to stay
the light oft intercepting of god's day
e'en in his temple  light too pure intense
which puts the eye out dazzles the weak sense
of mere humanity after its clay
shaping its images  but take thou good heed
thou dost not in self blindness and self pride
pluck down the temple's self and in its stead
and on its ruins strewed far and wide
building as not for living but true dead
a cenotaph for man's lost soul provide
o god  thou openest thy hand and lo
like clustered diamonds regardlessly
scattered therefrom the pleiads gem the sky
stars countless at a wafture thou dost throw
along the milky way their interflow
of radiance a cloud of light  still high
and higher far and farther beyond eye
and telescope and thought itself they go
as beyond sight thy power is infinite
so also in infinitesimal
in least as greatest great in depth as height
the infinitely small is only small
in term  creation unto which the mite
is huge for very smallness great we call
south africa thou land of many dreams
whose children do but scanty harvests reap
whose many dreams have set again in sleep
though still one glowing crop in sunlight gleams
thou land of unfulfill'd forgotten schemes
of pledge and promise  a pathetic heap
yet yet our hold upon thee will we keep
thy havens veld and kopjes and thy streams
we care not howsoe'er thy foes malign
but those the brood thou fosterest we scorn
who only love the gifts that make them thine
and honour not the land where they were born
thy children round thy neck will join their hands
and rise to make thee blesséd among lands
and here where throbs amid a silent waste
a myriad hammer'd hum whose siren sound
is heard re echoing the world around
luring with golden hope who hither haste
guided by fortune or by furies chased
to lose again such riches as they found
while still the patient worker wins the ground
where a new nation's future life is based
even here is heard a voice to swell the praise
of thy loved england who did mother thee
and thy world moving human pageantry
of thee too on whose glorious brow the bays
will yet be green when in dim æons to come
poets that sing of england will be dumb
from sky to sky the veld vast tawny bare
surrounds me like a vision in a dream
mysterious and unreal no flower or stream
no friendly smoke or stack is anywhere
e'en god's own living creatures are not there
no bird no bough whereon to perch no theme
whereof to sing to me there only seem
the sun sky veld the light immaculate air
whose great majestic archicraft did raise
this blue domed temple without priest or psalm
without a tone of all the diapase
with unascending incense without balm
without a worshipper in prayer or praise
mute with an incommunicable calm
with shimmering shoulders on the eastern steep
came dawn grey breathless in pursuit of night
his gold and sable mantle in his flight
her trembling outstretch'd fingers could not keep
a touch upon the folded wing of sleep
and he too sighing slipp'd beyond her sight
then did her body on the day alight
and glow exhausted in his bosom deep
so love with vain endeavour did pursue
a phantom fleet or one who loved him not
but ever fled from his approaching view
a visage shunn'd regretted unforgot
and met with her whom only he could win
waiting patient and warm to take him in
i lay beneath the afric stars awake
while all the neighbour noise of city slept
and all the solace of the silence crept
into the turmoil of my spirit's ache
and this worn heart whereon life's billows break
was smoothed the futile cares o'er which had wept
these weary eyes where careless joys had leapt
a slow and sweet transfiguring grace did take
with wide lids open to the glorious night
with soul and sense entranquill'd by the calm
i lay awake while in procession bright
the holy hymning stars with spheric psalm
bedew'd my inmost being with delight
yea with the fragrance of enduring balm
i left thee when the midnight bell had tolled
full of fresh hopes and feelings in thine eyes
all night perpetual meanings did unfold
quick turns of thought and kindling sympathies
still those blue eyes looked at me through my sleep
changed by the power of dreams to fearful things
they bore me far away where evening flings
her gorgeous blue on atlas they did sweep
into the bluer sky where comets blaze
and golden creatures live in starry rays
onward they went where filmy mist wreaths creep
about the rolling moon and fell with me
into the sunless caverns of the sea
where spirits all of blue into my soul did gaze
a spirit came upon me in the night
and led me gently down a rocky stair
unto a peopled garden green and fair
where all the day there was an evening light
trees out of every nation blended there
the citron shrub its golden fruit did train
against an english elm it was like a dream
because there was no wind and things did seem
all near and big like mountains before rain
far in those twilight bowers beside a stream
the soul of one who had but lately died
hung listening with a brother at his side
and no one spoke in all that haunted place
but looked quietly into each other's face
come now and see yon orient vale outspread
and mark the windings of my favourite rill
for the wan olive lights are on the hill
dear autumn's choicest boon and there is shed
a most surpassing glory on the stream
kindled just now by evening's purple gleam
yon lake with shady islands gave it birth
to it yon english village doth belong
and many a night the joyousness and mirth
of its dear flow hath been my vesper song
see how it peeps in meadows fringed with flowers
or nestles jealously mid leafy bowers
as if it almost felt and shunned to show
the gracefulness that makes men love it so
some fall in love with voices some with eyes
some men are linked together by a tear
others by smiles many who cannot tell
what time the angel passed who left the spell
it comes to us among the winds that rise
scattering their gifts on all things far and near
the fields of unripe corn the mountain lake
and the great hearted sea  all things do take
their glory and their witchery from winds
all save the few black pools the woodman finds
far in the depths of some unsunny place
which stand albeit the happy winds are out
in all the tossing branches round about
as silent and as fearful as a dead man's face
sweet are old courts with dates above the doors
and yew trees clipped in shapes and cedar walks
and lawns whereon a quiet peacock stalks
and leaden casements and black shining floors
and arm chairs carved like good cathedral stalls
and huge french clocks and bedsteads most inviting
and stiff old ladies hung upon the walls
famed in the days of english memoir writing
places whose very look kind thoughts might draw
even to anne stuart or william of nassau
sweeter than tudor stricken shrines are they
with pleasant grounds and rivers lingering by
quaint homes that shed a pure domestic ray
over the dull time of english history
i have known cities with the strong armed rhine
clasping their mouldered quays in lordly sweep
and lingered where the maine's low waters shine
through tyrian frankfort and been fain to weep
mid the green cliffs where pale mosella laves
that roman sepulchre imperial tregraveves
ghent boasts her steet and bruges her moonlight square
and holy mechlin rome of flanders stands
like a queen mother on her spacious lands
and antwerp shoots her glowing spire in air
yet have i seen no place by inland brook
hill top or plain or trim arcaded bowers
that carries age so nobly in its look
as oxford with the sun upon her towers
young men should not write sonnets if they dream
some day to reach the bright bare seats of fame
to such sweet thoughts and mighty feelings seem
as though like foreign things they rarely came
eager as men when haply they have heard
of some new songster some gay feathered bird
that hath over blue seas strayed in hope to find
in our thin foliage here a summer home
fain would they catch the bright things in their mind
and cage them into sonnets as they come
no they should serve their wants most sparingly
till the ripe time of song when young thoughts fail
then their sad sonnets like old bards might be
merry as youth and yet grey haired and hale
here in thy choice old city do i dwell
at thy dread feet most honoured clarendon
catching the precious words that one by one
fall from thy lips because i love full well
thy good and stately sadness and i prize
as warnings for this land the auguries
wherewith like fatal seeds thy pages swell
from these hot thoughts and tears too oft i fly
to the gay froissart and those wondrous men
who dreamed of honour and had heart to die
for their own brave and glorious dream and then
albeit with boyish lingerings again
i turn to graver books where by my side
lies origen my dear and perilous guide
fairest of rocky england's channel gates
with what a blessed calm to the main ocean
the ebbing tide with silent under motion
upward is drawn along thy weedy straits
the glossy water shot with blue and green
throws off the sunlight like the restless throat
of some vain dove and ships methinks might float
trusting the deep in places so serene
thus wreathed in folds of summer billow who
would deem old tales of wreck and tempest true
where yon vast marvel like an albatross
still springing upward as it seems in air
spreads in light grandeur his huge wings across
self poised in momentary balance there
he was a mild old man and cherished much
the weight dark egypt on his spirit laid
and with a sinuous eloquence would touch
for ever at that haven of the dead
single romantic words by him were thrown
as types on men and places with a power
like that of shifting sunlight after shower
kindling the cones of hills and journeying on
he feared the gods and heroes and spake low
that echo might not hear in her light room
he was a dweller underground for gloom
fitted old heathen goodness more than glow
and where love was not faith might gather mirth
from ore that glistened in pale beds of earth
nursling of heathen fear thy woful being
was steeped in gentleness by long disease
though round thine awestruck mind were ever fleeing
omens and signs and direful presages
one might believe in frames so gently stern
some christian thoughts before their time did burn
sadness was unto thee for love thy spirit
rose loftily like some hard featured stone
which summer sunbeam never makes its throne
e'en while it fills the skirts of vapour near it
one wert thou nicias of the few who urge
their stricken souls where far seen death doth hover
in vision on them nor may they diverge
from the black line his chilling shadows cover
thou mighty heathen wert not so bereft
of heavenly helps to thy great hearted deeds
that thou shouldst dig for truths in broken creeds
'mid the loose sands of four old empires left
motions and shadows dimly glowing fell
on thy broad soul from forms invisible
with its plain grandeur simple calm and free
what wonder was it that thy life should merit
sparkles of grace and angel ministry
with jealous glimpses of the world of spirit
greatest and best in this  that thy pure mind
upon its saving mission all intent
scorned the untruth of leaving books behind
to claim for thine what through thy lips was sent
oft in the crowd and crossings of old rome
the christ like shadow of the gifted paul
as he looked forth betimes from his hired home
might at this gentile's hurrying footsteps fall
when from his mournings in the caesar's hall
spurred by great thoughts the troubled sage might come
some balmy truths most surely did he borrow
from the sweet neighbourhood of christ to bring
the harsh hard waters of his heathen spring
in softening ducts o'er wastes of pagan sorrow
as slips of green from fertile confines shoot
into the tracts of sand so heathen duty
caught from his guided pen a cold bright beauty
where flowers might all but blossom into fruit
how many a year hath time with felon hand
filched from the sum of my alloted days
alas with no performance that may stand
in warrant of a well earned meed of praise
time hath the forehead of my life belined
and clipt my youth with his accursegraved shears
hath made companionable joy unkind
and taught mine eyes the fellowship of tears
his false hands falsely have my mind assailed
thence stealing many a secret of sweet pleasure
but his foiled fingers nothing have prevailed
against my heart  the casket of my treasure
my love of thee preserved in its fresh prime
i robbed left rich how poor a thief is time
o visioned face unutterably fair
how oft when blackness muffled up the night
and tempest laden was the surcharged air
nor any hope appeared of starry light
how often lucent as the full faced moon
when suddenly she rends the clouded fleece
hath thy sweet influence like an unhoped boon
turned dark to bright and tempest into peace
queen of my night of sorrows hast thou been
whose countenance of good all evil mars
knowing to crown with hopeful light serene
earth's darksome vault when most forlorn of stars
and to convert clouds bodeful of despair
to silver suited omens good and fair
when last we parted thou wert young and fair
how beautiful let fond remembrance say
alas since then old time has stolen away
full thirty years leaving my temples bare
so has it perished like a thing of air
the dream of love and youth  now both are grey
yet still remembering that delightful day
though time with his cold touch has blanched my hair
though i have suffered many years of pain
since then though i did never think to live
to hear that voice or see those eyes again
i can a sad but cordial greeting give
and for thy welfare breathe as warm a prayer
as when i loved thee young and fair
blown in the morning thou shalt fade ere noon
what boots a life which in such haste forsakes thee
th'art wondrous frolic being to die so soon
and passing proud a little colour makes thee
if thee thy brittle beauty so deceives
know then the thing that swells thee is thy bane
for the same beauty doth in bloody leaves
the sentence of thy early death contain
some clown's coarse lungs will poison thy sweet flower
if by the careless plough thou shalt be torn
and many herods lie in wait each hour
to murther thee as soon as thou art born
nay force thy bud to blow their tyrant breath
anticipating life to hasten death
i sometimes muse when my adventurous gaze
has roamed the starry arches of the night
that were i dowered with strong angelic sight
all would look changed in those pale heavenly ways
what wheeling worlds my vision would amaze
what chasms of gloom would thrill me and affright
what rhythmic equipoise would rouse delight
what moons would beam on me what suns would blaze
then through my awed soul sweeps the larger thought
of how creation's edict may have set
vast human multitudes on those far spheres
with towering passions to which mine mean naught
with majesties of happiness or yet
with agonies of unconjectured tears
a giant of awful strength he dumbly lies
far prisoned among the solemn deeps of earth
the sinewy grandeurs of his captive girth
his great thewed breast colossally moulded thighs
and arms thick roped with muscle of mighty size
repose in slumber where no dream gives birth
for months even years to any grief or mirth
a slumber of tranquil lips calm lidded eyes
yet sometimes to his spirit a dream will creep
of the old glad past when clothed in dauntless pride
he walked the world unchained by tyrannous powers
and then while he tosses restlessly in sleep
dark terrible graves for living shapes yawn wide
or a city shrieks among her tottering towers
dulled to a drowsy fire one hardly sees
the sun in heaven where this broad smoky round
lies ever brooding at the horizon's bound
and through the gaunt knolls on monotonous leas
or through the damp wood's troops of naked trees
rustling the brittle ruin along their ground
like sighs from souls of perished hours resound
the melancholy melodies of the breeze
so ghostly and strange a look the blurred world wears
viewed from the flowerless garden's dreary squares
that now while these weird vaporous days exist
it would not seem a marvel if where we walk
we met dim glimmering on its thorny stalk
some pale intangible rose with leaves of mist
what footstep but has wandered free and far
amid that castle of sleep whose walls were planned
by no terrestrial craft no human hand
with towers that point to no recorded star
here sorrows memories and remorses are
roaming the long dim rooms or galleries grand
here the lost friends our spirits yet demand
gleam through mysterious door ways left ajar
but of the uncounted throngs that ever win
the halls where slumber's dusky witcheries rule
who after wakening may reveal aright
by what phantasmal means he entered in
what porch of cloud what vapory vestibule
what stairway quarried from the mines of night
strange that in your dark dappled sanguine flower
the sculpturesque repose can still endure
of that celestial lily wrought so pure
it lives as chastity's white type this hour
by what mysterious art what baleful power
did you diana of all blooms allure
from nature's mood this maenad vestiture
and mock with gaudy tints your taintless dower
nay long ago i dream through some warm dell
of asian lands a weary tiger stole
where you in pale bud felt your first dews cling
and while he slept beneath you it befell
that all his deadly beauty pierced your soul
and made you this fantastic sultry thing
all search of yours but ineffectual seems
to gain some coign of refuge year by year
since far in loneliest woods in wastes austere
winds call beasts wander or yet the vulture screams
with hated sounds of life all nature teems
and even among the deeps of sleep you hear
voices now clad in distance or now clear
that float forever from the lips of dreams
but weary of spirit and affrighted too
at last you hurry away with footsteps fleet
to find in chaos torpor and eclipse
death your one lover inalienably true
encircled by whose ghostly arms you meet
the awful icy passion of his lips
invisible as a wind along the sky
she ever wanders o'er the earth immense
a spirit of beauty but malevolence
with foot unechoing and with furtive eye
she loathes and shuns all haunts where peace may lie
or love and every joy engendered thence
yet prowls to wait with wary and avid sense
for sorrow's heaviest and most burning sigh
then when some dreary sufferer darkly fails
to find in life's chill heaven one starry trace
one hope no menace of despair assails
toward him she steals with sure insidious pace
and slowly to his desperate look unveils
the maddening glooms and splendours of her face
seeing thy face with all thy fluctuant hair
falling in dull gold opulence from thy brow
watching thy light blue eyes now fired or now
laughterful or now dim as with despair
i wonder friend that it should be god's care
to have made at all what matter when or how
a being so sadly desolately rare
so beautifully incomplete as thou
o rank black pool with one star's imaged form
o sweet rich hearted rose with rot at core
o summer heaven half purpled by stern storm
o lily with one white leaf dipt in gore
o angel shape whereover curves and clings
the awful imminence of a devil's wings
troubled in spirit at the unvaried ways
wherewith perpetually i seemed to view
in regular and familiar retinue
coming and going the processional days
i yearned to mark with many a novel phase
this round of dull monotonies that i knew
and treat life's commonplaces dreary of hue
as phantoms that the intellect sternly lays
but wheresoe'er my wandering feet might be
like some persistent word that memory saith
or like a ship's own shadow on wastes of sea
or the very wind's inevitable breath
i found among all changes following me
the dark ubiquitous commonplace of death
a yellow sunset soft and dreamy of dye
met sharply by black fluctuant lines of grass
a river glimmering like illumined glass
and narrowing till it ends in distant sky
pale scattered pools of luminous rain that lie
in shadowy amplitudes of green morass
a crescent that the old moon as moments pass
has turned to a silver acorn hung on high
now through this melancholy and silent land
sleep walks diaphanous vestured vaguely fair
within her vaporous robe and one dim hand
much asphodel and lotus doth she bear
going lovely and low lidded with a band
of dull red poppies amid her dull gold hair
paul let thy faces from the canvas look
haply less clearly than pietro's can
less lively than in tints of titian
or him who both the bay wreath chaplets took
yet shalt thou therefore have no harsh rebuke
of me whom while with eager eye i scan
o'er painted pomps of brera and vatican
the first delight thou gavest ne'er forsook
for in thy own verona long ago
before one masterpiece of cool arcades
i made a friend and such a friend was rare
for him i love thy velvet's glorious show
thy sheens of silk 'twixt marble balustrades
thy breathing space and full translucent air
loved for themselves too oft as i behold
adown the curtain'd gallery's sumptuous gloom
a separate daylight shining in the room
there find i still thy groupings manifold
of holy clerks of nobles grave and bold
swart slaves brave gallants maidens in their bloom
with what of persian and ligarian loom
may best consort with marble dome and gold
there find thy dog whose teeth time's teeth defy
to raze the name from less enduring leaves
of loved canossa there in cynic ease
thy monkey and beneath the pearly sky
see lovely ladies wave their handkerchiefs
and lend sweet looks from airy balconies
they err who say this long withdrawing line
of palace fronts palladian this brocade
from looms of genoa this gold inlaid
resplendent plate of milan that combine
to spread soft lustre through the grand design
show but in fond factitious masquerade
the actual feast by leper simon made
for that great guest of old in palestine
christ walks amongst us still at liberal table
scorns not to sit no sorrowing magdalene
but of these dear feet kindly gets her kiss
now even as then and thou be honorable
who by the might of thy majestic scene
bringest down that age and minglest it with this
see where the pilgrim bound for mecca's shrine
yon weary steps and way worn robes proclaim
is not his pilgrimage akin to mine
is not our errand somewhat of the same
for not even mecca's venerated name
nor yet medina where the prophet lies
receives the homage nor can boast the fame
of those dim tombs that now before me rise
alas proud city  and is this the sight
that first attracts the distant stranger's gaze
nor fort nor palace tells the moslem's might
alone the giant tombs of other days
obscure and shadowy in the early light
as clouds on the horizon he surveys
and where is he who like a raging flame
the koran or the sword his battlecry
from mecca's shores with conquering amru came
in his own city here of victory
one only bears a heavier yoke than he
what can that faith do for him in his need
it teaches him to bear adversity
with patience that may shame a better creed
see what he is to know what he has been
go view the tombs  ye shall not see them long
where the old caliphs sleep  or climb his strong
old fortress on the rock and view the scene
spread at your feet and ye may picture then
the ancient glory of the saracen
art's infant home and learning's earliest school
the world's great college mystic wisdom's shrine
seat of the king priest's more than regal rule
fair city of the sun and what of thine
remains to tell how glorious how divine
thy temples rose one solitary stone
surviving a memorial and a sign
still points to him for whom thy temples shone
pause here it is holy ground whereon we stand
the virgin with her offspring when she fled
from herod's fury laid her weary head
beneath yon reverend tree  with gentle hand
ah touch these frail traditions  for they shed
a ray round many a spot that else were drear and dread
yes yon stern lines do but embody one
one stern unchanging omnipresent thought
that dwelt a deadly incubus upon
the builder's soul and in his nature wrought
with giant efforts all his life he sought
to fling the fearful burden from his mind
and left at last in visible shape behind
its type this load the heaviest ever brought
by man upon the weary earth to press
in this stupendous form is tangibly
that thought portrayed eternity  no less
eternity mistaken never ye
who do not faith surpassing faith possess
no  never look into eternity
there shall be beds full of light odours blent
divans great couches deep profound as tombs
and frown for us in light magnificent
over the flower stand there shall droop strange blooms
careful of their last flame declining
as two vast torches our two hearts shall flare
and our two spirits in their double shining
reflect the double lights enchanted there
one night  a night of mystic blue of rose
a look will pass supreme from me from you
like a long sob laden with long adieux
and later on an angel will unclose
the door and entering joyously re light
the tarnished mirrors and the flames blown to the night
within his eyes are hung lamps of the sanctuary
a wind from whence none knows can set in sway
and spill their light by fits but yet their ray
returns deep boled to its obscurity
the world as from a dullard turns annoyed
to stir the days with show or deeds or voices
but if one spies him justly one rejoices
with silence that the careful lips avoid
he is a plan a work of some strange passion
life has conceived apart from time's harsh drill
a thing it hides and cherishes to fashion
at odd bright moments to its secret will
holy and foolish ever set apart
he waits the leisure of his god's free heart
the lethargy of evil in her eyes
as blue snow is the substance of a mere
where the dead waters of a glacier drear
stand open and behold  a viper lies
brooding upon her hatreds dying thus
wounded and broken helpless with her fangs
she dies of her sealed curse yea of her pangs
at god's first ban that made her infamous
yet by that old curse frozen in her wreath
she like a star hath central gravity
that draws and fascinates the soul to death
while round her stark and terrible repose
vaults for its hour a glittering sapphire fly
mocking the charm of death o god it knows
a lover of the woods and streams and sky
the quiet lake 'neath evening's level light
and all of nature's summer sound and sight
thou look'st upon her with a poet's eye
and when from drifting boat thou'st cast a fly
to wait with eager heart for sudden bite
where all the depths of mystery excite
thou still hast joy though all the fish go by
and when red summer suns have sunk to rest
and thy true preacher's work has come again
with tender care thou'rt happy in the quest
of human souls and with thy golden pen
thou searchest for the good in every breast
still largely loving all that's best in men
rain and a glare of lamps set in the rain
where seekers for numb brains and deadened wills
stagger like helpless idiots through the pain
of vain remembrance of increasing ills
the dazzle of light in the darkness thickly fills
the breadth of street with long and snake like stain
of false gold which the weak sight blinds and kills
while through it all come slipping by amain
like vast black birds of prey with eyes aglow
the automobiles mid shrieks and howls of lust
no deeper tragedy the earth can know
than this its night of pain and rain and rust
where death is only death and nothingness
as once i wandered lonely in the night
upon some grey and grimy street belated
i saw a sad man and a woman white
clasped in a doorway low unconsecrated
and they were parting for their sobs came thick
across the street to where i wandered deeming
that all the world with ugliness was sick
and that life held no moments worth esteeming
vision of the night you mocked me then
with sudden floods of beauty power and glory
i saw the paltry weak desires of men
rise from our hearts and conquer song and story
and flout the idle gods who do not love us
and sweep away the swarm of stars above us
it is the hour when all is dark and still
when long despair brief hope alike resign
their ancient dominance of human will
when life no longer to the far sea line
bends its gray sails worn with the winds of ill
seeking those unseen lands beyond the brine
which never through the bitter foam and chill
a man shall mark and marvel as they shine
it is the hour of silence no one cares
to think of toil now asking what is done
by all our effort endlessly onstreaming
for we are sick of mocking sly despairs
and we would rest as if all time were gone
filling the hour of peace with foolish dreaming
in every night some haggard hours there are
whose passing is unnoted save by those
unconquered by dim slumber and her shows
the wretched and the houseless near and far
and those for whom the night cannot unbar
the common gate to her divine repose
whose nerves are torn by living and its woes
until they sink in some melee of war
these know and these alone the secret things
the mysteries which those who see must die
the silent spaces of which no one sings
the grey death minutes fading till on high
aloft there flash the sudden glorious wings
of dawn and fill with light the hollow sky
you that have gazed long on the city s splendour
behold its life how thick and red it runs
from dawn to dusk and on through countless suns
self spending self creating fixed untender
coarse deathless changeless do you homage render
to that which with its power the spirit stuns
and will until all things are as they once
were in the grip of death the sole amender
thousands of years ago thus in the grime
life struggled as it struggles on to day
as it must struggle till its latest scene
no change shall ever be except in time
until all things as dreams are swept away
and the earth is as if it ne'er had been
like ruddy or tawny masses of torn flame
over the whirlpool seething in agony
defiantly they flap and shake on high
the electricity of life that ever the same
fulminates in the city's pain and shame
and streams in smoke clouds towards the ashen sky
a roaring chaos of wrath and mystery
fashioned to pleasure that which has no name
banners on banners heavily everywhere
soul oriflammes of blood and hate and lust
burst flickering through the abysms of the air
leap condors chained it is our will you must
and scream our tragedy even to those dim
veils of the dawn where red stars flicker grim
time is a heavy legend to be told
by this slight clock shapely and full of guile
with brilliants at its throat the sun in gold
louis' own seal above its painted smile
some clocks have souls they grow into a wall
become a part of lives they tick away
this is a toy perfect sufficient all
unto itself  a butterfly at bay
hours and years they change but do not pass
in this light world of gold and ormolu
time is one splendid moment under glass
mad little clock so gay it never knew
blood on the hours a lifted pike  a head
and hot throats roaring that the king is dead
within the still white room that gave me birth
my body bloomed the counterpart of two
who bore me but alone across the earth
miles from that place the heart they never knew
by wise moon fairies on a far high hill
was being woven out of threads of mist
its fragile beauty was a thing more still
than any lake the wind has ever kissed
and i have borne it secretly within
a shy soft wonder sleeping at my breast
and such has been dissemblance i could win
that even those who bore me have not guessed
when misty moonlight blows from tree to tree
how near they are at last to finding me
when i shall die  and be it late or soon
let merciful memories be my only shroud
think me a light veiled in a morning cloud
living to knowledge  like a finished moon
though nothing here to other lands a boon
nor let my death give triumph to the proud
by your weak tears be happy with the crowd
who spite of woe are seldom out of tune
wise in the common instinct be ye glad
there's some redemption in the doom of death
that cuts us from new sins  sweet mercy's plan
yet if for me you be sincerely sad
do this sweet homage to my valued breath
ease the sad burden of some living man
admiring stranger that with lingering feet
enchained by wonder pauses on this green
where thy enraptured sight the dark woods meet
ah rest awhile and contemplate the scene
these hoary pillars clasped by ivy round
this hallowed floor by holy footsteps trod
the mouldering choir by spreading moss embrowned
where fasting saints devoutly hymned their god
unpitying time with slow but certain sweep
has laid alas their ancient splendour low
yet here let pilgrims while they muse and weep
think on the lesson that from hence may flow
like theirs how soon may be the tottering state
of man  the temple of a shorter date
fine animated gem whose sparkling light
as on the verdant bank thou liest reclined
spangles with gold the sable skirts of night
thy bright beams wake the traveller's sleeping mind
over thee the blasts of heaven innoxious blow
safe from the rushing wild storm is thy seat
under the sheltering leaf thy beauties glow
how man might envy thy obscure retreat
modest and meek thou shunst the glare of day
hidden within its shell thy little head
could he like thee but shun ambition's ray
content the placid paths of life to tread
his frequent sighs of sorrow then would cease
sighs poured at blasted hopes and murdered peace
i will not rail or grieve when torpid eld
frosts the slow journeying blood for i shall see
the lovelier leaves hang yellow on the tree
the nimbler brooks in icy fetters held
methinks the aged eye that first beheld
pale autumn in her waning pageantry
then knew himself dear nature child of thee
marking the common doom that all compelled
no kindred we to thy belovegraved brods
if dying these we drew a selfish breath
but one path travel all their multitudes
and none dispute the solemn voice that saith
sun to thy setting to your autumn woods
stream to thy sea and man unto thy death
this little light is not a little sign
of duteous service innocent of blame
contented with obscurity till came
mandate that as a star her beam should shine
on sickness did she wait or scribe or shrine
the law of her beneficence the same
somewhat to sunder from her fragile frame
something of her own being to resign
so wasted now that let the lustre be
resummoned but once more the fuel dies
yet virtues six dorn her brevity
singly too seldom met of mortal eyes
discretion faithfulness frugality
purity vigilance self sacrifice
i saw the youthful singers of my day
to sound of lutes and lyres in morning hours
trampling with eager feet the teeming flowers
bound for fame's temple upon music's way
a happy band a folk of holiday
but some lay down and slept among the bowers
some turned aside to fanes of alien powers
some death took by the hand and led away
now gathering twilight clouds the land with grey
yet where last light is lit last pilgrims go
outlined in gliding shade by dying glow
and fain with weary fortitude essay
the last ascent the end is hid but they
who follow on my step shall surely know
poet whose unscarr'd feet have trodden hell
by what grim path and dread environing
of fire couldst thou that dauntless footstep bring
and plant it firm amid the dolorous cell
of darkness where perpetually dwell
the spirits cursed beyond imagining
or else is thine a visionary wing
and all thy terror but a tale to tell
neither and both thou seeker i have been
no wilder path than thou thyself dost go
close mask'd in an impenetrable screen
which having rent i gaze around and know
what tragic wastes of gloom before unseen
curtain the soul that strives and sins below
you must not wonder though you think it strange
to see me hold my lowering head so low
and that mine eyes take no delight to range
about the gleams which on your face do grow
the mouse which once hath broken out of trap
is seldom teased with the trustless bait
but lies aloof for fear of more mishap
and feedeth still in doubt of deep deceit
the scorched fly which once hath 'scap'd the flame
will hardly come to play again with fire
whereby i learn that grievous is the game
which follows fancy dazzled by desire
so that i wink or else hold down my head
because your blazing eyes my bale have bred
if in the summer of thy bright regard
for one brief season these poor rhymes shall live
i ask no more nor think my fate too hard
if other eyes but wintry looks should give
nor will i grieve though what i here have writ
o'erburdened time should drop among the ways
and to the unremembering dust commit
beyond the praise and blame of other days
the song doth pass but i who sing remain
i pluck from death's own heart a life more deep
and as the spring that dies not in her train
doth scatter blossoms for the winds to reap
so i immortal as i fare along
will strew my path with mortal flowers of song
o steep and rugged life whose harsh ascent
slopes blindly upward through the bitter night
they say that on thy summit high in light
sweet rest awaits the climber travel spent
but i alas with dusty garments rent
with fainting heart and failing limbs and sight
can see no glimmer of the shining height
and vainly list with body forward bent
to catch athwart the gloom one wandering note
of those glad anthems which they say are sung
when one emerges from the mists below
but though o life thy summit be remote
and all thy stony path with darkness hung
yet ever upward through the night i go
what is a sonnet 'tis the pearly shell
that murmurs of the far off murmuring sea
a precious jewel carved most curiously
it is a little picture painted well
what is a sonnet 'tis the tear that fell
from a great poet's hidden ecstasy
a two edged sword a star a song  ah me
sometimes a heavy tolling funeral bell
this was the flame that shook with dante's breath
the solemn organ whereon milton played
and the clear glass where shakespeare's shadow falls
a sea this is  beware who ventureth
for like a fjord the narrow floor is laid
mid ocean deep to the sheer mountain walls
the speech that day doth utter and the night
full oft to mortal ears it hath no sound
dull are our eyes to read upon the ground
what's written there and stars are hid by light
so when the dark doth fall awhile our sight
kens the unwonted orbs that circle round
the quick in sleep our human sense is bound
speechless for us the starry heavens and bright
but when the day doth close there is one word
that's writ amid the sunset's golden embers
and one at morn by them our hearts are stirred
splendour of dawn  and evening that remembers
these are the rhymes of god thus line on line
our souls are moved to thoughts that are divine
when shall true love be love without alloy
shine free at last from sinful circumstance
when shall the canker of unheavenly chance
eat not the bud of that most heavenly joy
when shall true love meet love not as a coy
retreating light that leads a deathful dance
but as a firm fixed fire that doth enhance
the beauty of all beauty will the employ
of poets ever be too well to show
that mightiest love with sharpest pain doth writhe
that underneath the fair caressing glove
hides evermore the iron hand and though
love's flower alone is good if we could prove
its perfect bloom our breath slays like a scythe
my love for thee doth march like armeacuted men
against a queenly city they would take
along the army's front its banners shake
across the mountain and the sun smit plain
it steadfast sweeps the steadfast rain
and now the trumpet makes the still air quake
and now the thundering cannon doth awake
echo on echo echoing loud again
but lo the conquest higher than bard had sung
instead of answering cannon comes a small
white flag the iron gates are open flung
and flowers along the invaders' pathway fall
the city's conquerors feast their foes among
and their brave flags are trophies on her wall
i know thou art not that brown mountain side
nor the pale mist that lies along the hills
and with white joy the deepening valley fills
nor yet the solemn river moving wide
into that valley where the hills abide
but whence those morning clouds on noiseless wheels
shall lingering lift and as the moonlight steals
from out the heavens so into the heavens shall glide
i know thou art not this gray rock that looms
above the water fringed with scarlet vine
nor flame of burning meadow nor the sedge
that sways and trembles at the river's edge
but through all these dear heart to me there comes
some melancholy absent look of thine
o highest strongest sweetest woman soul
thou holdest in the compass of thy grace
all the strange fate and passion of thy race
of the old primal curse thou knowest the whole
thine eyes too wise are heavy with the dole
the doubt the dread of all this human maze
thou in the virgin morning of thy days
hast felt the bitter waters o'er thee roll
yet thou knowest too the terrible delight
the still content and solemn ecstasy
whatever sharp sweet bliss thy kind may know
thy spirit is deep for pleasure as for woe
deep as the rich dark caverned awful sea
that the keen winded glimmering dawn makes white
this is the earth he walked on not alone
that asian country keeps the sacred stain
'tis not alone the far judaean plain
mountain and river lo the sun that shone
on him shines now on us when day is gone
the moon of galilee comes forth again
and lights our path as his an endless chain
of years and sorrows makes the round world one
the air we breathe he breathed  the very air
that took the mould and music of his high
and godlike speech  since then shall mortal dare
with base thought front the ever sacred sky
soil with foul deed the ground whereon he laid
in holy death his pale immortal head
at last 'tis gone the fever of the day
thank god there comes an end to everything
under the night cloud's deepened shadowing
the noises of the city drift away
thro' sultry streets and alleys and the grey
fogs round the great cathedral rise and cling
i long and long  but no desire will bring
against my face the keen wind salt with spray
o far away green waves your voices call
your cool lips kiss the wild and weedy shore
and out upon the sea line sails are brown
white sea birds crying hover  soft shades fall
deep waters dimple round the dripping oar
and last rays light the little fishing town
poor child of sorrow who didst boldly spring
like sapient pallas from thy parent's brain
all armed in mail of proof and thou wouldst fain
leap further yet and on exulting wing
rise to the summit of the printer's press
but cruel hand hath nipped thy buds amain
hath fixed on thee the darkling inky stain
hath soiled thy splendour and defiled thy dress
where are thy full orbed moon and sky serene
and where thy waving foam and foaming wave
all all are blotted by the murderous pen
and lie unhonoured in their papery grave
weep gentle sonnets sonneteers deplore
and vow  and keep your vow  you'll write no more
believe me dear unyielding though i be
ambitions flourish only in the sun
in noisy daylight every race is run
with lusty pride for all the world to see
when darkness sinks the earth in mystery
when eye or ear or sight or sound is none
but death a tide that waits to bear us on
and life a loosening anchor in the sea
when time and space are huge about the soul
and ties of custom lost beyond recall
and courage as a garment in the flame
then all my spirit breaks without control
then the heart opens then the hot tears fall
to prove me wholly woman that i am
the blue heaven spreads before me with its keen
and countless eyes of brightness  worlds are there
the boldest spirit cannot spring and dare
the peopled universe that burns between
this earth and nothing  thought can wing its way
swifter than lightning flashes or the beam
that hastens on the pinions of the morn
but quicker than the glowing dart of day
it tires and faints along the starry stream
a wave of suns through countless ether borne
though infinite eternal yet one power
sits on the almighty center whither tend
all worlds and beings from time's natal hour
till suns and all their satellites shall end
dear love i sometimes think how it would be
if thou shouldst love me if on such a day
o day of wonder thou shouldst come and say
i love thee or but let me guess thy plea
if once thine eyes should brighten suddenly
if once thy step should hasten or delay
because of me if once thy hand should stay
a needless instant in my own ah me
from such imaginings i wake and start
and dull and worthless life's endeavours seem
before the tender beauty of my dream
and then i whisper my impatient heart
be still be comforted o heart of mine
thou art not all bereft the dream is thine
what curled and scented sun girls almond eyed
with lotus blossoms in their hands and hair
have made their swarthy lovers call them fair
with these spent strings when brutes were deified
and memnon in the sunrise sprang and cried
and love winds smote bubastis and the bare
black breasts of carven pasht received the prayer
of suppliants bearing gifts from far and wide
this lute has outsung egypt all the lives
of violent passion and the vast calm art
that lasts in granite only all lie dead
this little bird of song alone survives
as fresh as when its fluting smote the heart
last time the brown slave wore it garlanded
phoeligbus what voice is this that wails above the deep
alcyone a wife's that mourns her fate and loveless days
phoeligbus what love lies buried in these waterways
alcyone a husband's hurried to eternal sleep
phoeligbus cease o beloved cease to wail and weep
alcyone wherefore
phoeligbus the waters in a fiery blaze
proclaim the godhead of my healing rays
alcyone no god can sow where fate hath stood to reap
phoeligbus hold wringing hands cease piteous tears to fall
alcyone but grief must rain and glut the passionate sea
phoeligbus thou shall forget this ocean and thy wrong
and i will bless the dead though past recall
alcyone what can'st thou give to me or him in me
phoeligbus a name in story and a light in song
a bounding satyr golden in the beard
that leaps with goat feet high into the air
and crushes from the thyme an odour rare
keeps watch around the marble tomb revered
of sophocles the poet loved and feared
whose mighty voice once called out of her lair
the dorian muse severe with braided hair
who loved the thyrsus and wild dances weird
here all day long the pious bees can pour
libations of their honey round this tomb
the dionysiac ivy loves to roam
the satyr laughs but he awakes no more
wrapped up in silence at the grave's cold core
nor sees the sun wheel round in the white dome
not pale as one in sleep or holier death
nor illcontent the lady seems nor loth
to lie in shadow of shrill river growth
so steadfast are the river's arms beneath
pale petals follow her in very faith
unmixed with pleasure or regret and both
her maidly hands look up in noble sloth
to take the blossoms of her scattered wreath
no weakest ripple lives to kiss her throat
nor dies in meshes of untangled hair
no movement stirs the floor of river moss
until some furtive glimmer gleam across
voluptuous mouth where even teeth are bare
and gild the broidery of her petticoat
geranium houseleek laid in oblong beds
on the trim grass the daisies' leprous stain
is fresh each night the daisies burst again
though every day the gardener crops their heads
a wistful child in foul unwholesome shreds
recalls some legend of a daisy chain
that makes a pretty necklace she would fain
make one and wear it if she had some threads
sun leprous flowers foul child the asphalt burns
the garrulous sparrows perch on metal burns
sing sing they say and flutter with their wings
he does not sing he only wonders why
he is sitting there the sparrows sing and i
yield to the strait allure of simple things
conquered the flower maidens and the wide embrace
of their round proffered arms that tempt the virgin boy
conquered the trickling of their babbling tongues the coy
back glances and the mobile breasts of subtle grace
conquered the woman beautiful the fatal charm
of her hot breast the music of her babbling tongue
conquered the gate of hell into the gate the young
man passes with the heavy trophy at his arm
the holy javelin that pierced the heart of god
he heals the dying king he sits upon the throne
king and high priest of that great gift the living blood
in robe of gold the youth adores the glorious sign
of the green goblet worships the mysterious wine
and oh the chime of children's voices in the dome
'gainst the dusk gold of morn's candescent sky
strike dome and campanile sharp and clear
jangling sweet bells on the still city's ear
strange scents of musk and myrtle hover nigh
the frail pomegranate blossoms hanging high
above the dark canal drop straight and sheer
drift on a crimson fleet then disappear
high heap'd with sun kiss'd fruits the boats go by
with cadenc'd oar to the gay market place
where purple bloomy grapes for very stress
of swollen sweetness burst and spill their wine
where bronzeacuted melons lie in shade and shine
and the sea city's definite impress
glows in swart splendour from each dusky face
october's gold is dim  the forests rot
the weary rain falls ceaseless while the day
is wrapp'd in damp in mire of village way
the hedge row leaves are stamped and all forgot
the broodless nest sits visible in the thorn
autumn among her drooping marigolds
weeps all her garnered sheaves and empty folds
and dripping orchards  plundered and forlorn
the season is a dead one and i die
no more no more for me the spring shall make
a resurrection in the earth and take
the death from out her heart  o god i die
the cold throat mist creeps nearer till i breathe
corruption drop stark night upon my death
in vain to me the smiling mornings shine
and reddening phoebus lifts his golden fire
the birds in vain their amorous descant join
or cheerful fields resume their green attire
these ears alas for other notes repine
a different object do these eyes require
my lonely anguish melts no heart but mine
and in my breast the imperfect joys expire
yet morning smiles the busy race to cheer
and newborn pleasure brings to happier men
the fields to all their wonted tribute bear
to warm their little loves the birds complain
i fruitless mourn to him that cannot hear
and weep the more because i weep in vain
cupid thou naughty boy when thou wert loathed
naked and blind for vagabonding noted
thy nakedness i in my reason clothed
mine eyes i gave thee so was i devoted
fie wanton fie who would show children kindness
no sooner he into mine eyes was gotten
but straight he clouds them with a seeing blindness
makes reason wish that reason were forgotten
from thence to myra's eyes the wanton strayeth
where while i charge him with ungrateful measure
so with fair wonders he mine eyes betrayeth
that my wounds and his wrongs become my pleasure
till for more spite to myra's heart he flyeth
where living to the world to me he dieth
fie foolish earth think you the heaven wants glory
because your shadows do yourself benight
all's dark unto the blind let them be sorry
but love still in herself finds her delight
fie fond desire think you that love wants glory
because your shadows do yourself benight
the hopes and fears of lust may make men sorry
the heavens in themselves are ever bright
then earth stand fast the sky that you benight
will turn again and so restore your glory
desire be steady hope is your delight
an orb wherein no creature can be sorry
love being placed above these middle regions
where every passion wars itself with legions
ye daffodilian days whose fallen towers
shielded our paradisal prime from ill
fair past fair motherhood let come what will
we being yours defy the anarch powers
for us the happy tidings fell in showers
enjewelling the wind from every hill
we drained the sun against the winter's chill
our ways were barricadoed in with flowers
and if from skyey minsters now unhoused
earth's massy workings at the forge we hear
the black roll of the congregated sea
and war's live hoof o yet last year last year
we were the lark lulled shepherdlings that drowsed
grave deep at noon in grass of arcady
dear witnesses all luminous eloquent
stacked thickly on the tessellated floor
the soldier blood stirs in me as of yore
in sire and grandsire who to battle went
i seem to know the shaded valley tent
the armed and bearded men the thrill of war
horses that prance to hear the cannon roar
shrill bugle calls and camp fire merriment
and as fair symbols of heroic things
not void of tears mine eyes must e'en behold
these banners lovelier as the deeper marred
a panegyric never writ for kings
on every tarnished staff and tattered fold
and by them tranquil spirits standing guard
is this thy paphos  the devoted place
where rests in its own eventide thy shrine
to thee not lone is solitude divine
where love dreams o'er thy waves each other chase
and melt into the passion of thy face
the twilight waters dolphin stained are thine
the silvery depths and blue night orbed entwine
and in bright films thy rosy form embrace
girdling thy loins with heaven spun drapery
wove in the looms of thy resplendent sea
the columns point their shadows to the plain
and ancient days are dialed o'er again
the floods remember falling at thy feet
upon the sands of time they ever beat
the outward world for rugged toil designed
where evil from true good the crown hath riven
hath been to men's dominion ever given
but woman's empire holier more refined
moulds moves and sways the fallen yet god breathed mind
lifting the earth crushed heart to hope and heaven
as plants put forth to summer's gentle wind
and 'neath the sweet soft light of starry even
those treasures which the tyrant winter's sway
could never wrest from nature  so the soul
will woman's sweet and tender power obey
thus doth her summer smile its strength control
her love sows flowers along life's thorny way
her star bright faith leads up towards heaven's goal
i cannot measure for thee drop by drop
thy draught of love my hands dear tremble so
behold the chalice how the bright drops glow
and still i pour although thou bid'st me stop
till the rich wine mounts to the goblet's top
and the dry earth receives the overflow
too generous am i ah say not so
love that doth count its gifts is a weak prop
whereon to stay a weary human heart
yes draw me closer love perchance i may
clasped in thine arms forget the dreaded day
when thou my love my soul my life's best part
in cold satiety wild turn thee round
and dash the poor cup broken to the ground
even thus methinks a city reared should be
yea an imperial city that might hold
five times an hundred noble towns in fee
and either with their might of babel old
or the rich roman pomp of empery
might stand compare highest in arts enrolled
highest in arms brave tenement for the free
who never crouch to thrones or sin for gold
thus should her towers be raised  with vicinage
of clear bold hills that curve her very streets
as if to vindicate 'mid choicest seats
of art abiding nature's majesty
and the broad sea beyond in calm or rage
chainless alike and teaching liberty
fourteen small broidered berries on the hem
of circe's mantle each of magic gold
fourteen of lone calypso's tears that rolled
into the sea for pearls to come of them
fourteen clear signs of omen in the gem
with which medea human fate foretold
fourteen small drops which faustus growing old
craved of the fiend to water life's dry stem
it is the pure white diamond dante brought
to beatrice the sapphire laura wore
when petrarch cut it sparkling out of thought
the ruby shakespeare hewed from his heart's core
the dark deep emerald that rossetti wrought
for his own soul to wear for evermore
in dim green depths rot ingot laden ships
and gold doubloons that from the drowned hand fell
lie nestled in the ocean flower's bell
with love's old gifts once kissed by long drowned lips
and round some wrought gold cup the sea grass whips
and hides lost pearls near pearls still in their shell
where sea weed forests fill each ocean dell
and seek dim sunlight with their restless tips
so lie the wasted gifts the long lost hopes
beneath the now hushed surface of myself
in lonelier depths than where the diver gropes
they lie deep deep but i at times behold
in doubtful glimpses on some reefy shelf
the gleam of irrecoverable gold
what wast thou little baby that art dead
a one day's blossom that the hoar frost nips
a bee that's crusht the first bright day it sips
a small dropt gem that in the earth we tread
or cherub's smiling gold encircled head
that death from out life's painted missal rips
or murmured prayer that barely reached the lips
or sonnet's fair first line  the rest unsaid
oh 'tis not hard to find what thou wast like
the world is full of fair unfinished things
that vanish like a dawn admonished elf
life teems with opening forms for death to strike
the woods are full of unfledged broken wings
enough for us thou wast thy baby self
lo through the open window of the room
that was her nursery a small bright spark
comes wandering in as falls the summer dark
and with a measured flight explores the gloom
as if it sought among the things that loom
vague in the dusk for sume familiar mark
and like a light on some wee unseen bark
it tacks in search of who knows what or whom
i know 'tis but a fire fly yet its flight
so straight so measured round the empty bed
might be a little soul's that night sets free
and as it nears i feel my heart grow tight
with something like a superstitious dread
and watch it breathless lest it should be she
the robin gave three hops and chirp'd and said
yes i knew puck and loved him though i trow
he mimick'd oft my whistle chuckling low
yes i knew cousin puck but he is dead
we found him lying on his mushroom bed
the wren and i  half cover'd up with snow
as we were hopping where the berries grow
we think he died of cold ay puck is fled
and then the wood mouse said we made the mole
dig him a little grave beneath the moss
and four big dormice placed him in the hole
the squirrel made with sticks a little cross
puck was a christian elf and had a soul
and all we velvet jackets mourn his loss
who summons back forgotten banished names
whose magic voice bids buried cities rise
who opes again the gates of paradise
where gleaming sword of guardian angel flames
who fires the generous heart with godlike aims
who leads the way were fame's high temple lies
who fills the soul with hope which never dies
who rouses courage while he passion tames
the poet he whose words are living things
who walks the earth clothed with creative might
who touches life's most hidden secret springs
and out of darkness brings the flood of light
who speaks and souls receive the dower of wings
and upward mount to the aerial height
shall we believe the heavens less divine
because earth moves and the great sun is still
or is the world less fair because mere thrill
of ether gives the stars the power to shine
shall diamonds with less lustre fair necks twine
since we have found how nature's cunning skill
black carbon's heart with light has known to fill
kindling a lamp in darkness of deep mine
not so to poet's eye shall it appear
whose wonder grows with knowledge keeping pace
who to all truth lends an impartial ear
and behind law still sees god's hidden grace
like a dim milky way when night is clear
and all the stars look on the young moon's face
hast thou then wrapped us in thy shadow death
already in the very dawn of joy
and in cold triumph dreamest to destroy
the last and dearest hope which lingereth
within my desolated heart to blast
the young unfolding bud and dash away
as in some desert demon's cruel play
the cup my parch'd lips had begun to taste
o impotent o very phantom know
bounds are there to thy ravage even here
sanctuaries inaccessible to fear
are in the heart of man while yet below
love not of sense can wake such communings
as are among the soul's eternal things
o brooding spirit of wisdom and of love
whose mighty wings even now o'ershadow me
absorb me in thine own immensity
and raise me far my finite self above
purge vanity away and the weak care
that name or fame of me should widely spread
and the deep wish keep burning in their stead
thy blissful influence afar to bear
or see it borne let no desire of ease
no lack of courage faith or love delay
my own steps in that high thought paven way
in which my soul her clear commission sees
yet with an equal joy let me behold
thy chariot o'er that way by others roll'd
white wings that over the hyacinthine sea
with joy or hope or sorrow long have sped
since first he voyaged whom the colchian wed
bearing lone ships over many a salt degree
a voice came thence where ye were wont to be
a strange and serpent utterance high over head
trailed its dark breath and with ixion's tread
a keel passed by mocking the stormy lee
into the rack far lessening on it went
as once that antique lover of the cloud
while ye to veering winds were bowed and bent
and ocean roared with his great voice aloud
lashing his waves gainst isle and continent
vexed with the wake that wheel borne ship had ploughed
when i remember how nor separate chance
nor restless traffic peopling many a shore
nor old tradition with innumerous lore
but poets wrought our best inheritance
sweet words and noble in their gai science
that england heard and then for evermore
loved as her own and did with deeds adore
i bless thee with a kindred heart provence
for to thy tales like waves that come and go
sat chaucer listening with exulting ear
and casting his own phrase in giant mould
that still had charms for sorrow's gentlest tear
telling the story of griselda's woe
under the roots of vesulus the cold
soft comes the breath of spring it shakes the pear
white blooming like a garden seems the mead
thick with young grass on which the cattle feed
tossing their heads at their dull wintry fare
the bees seek honey through the moving air
that rocks the wild duck on her nest of reed
by the sunlit water man doth say god speed
for joy the year's increase so soon to share
low to himself he says it where alas
are the old rites a dullard race are we
clear shows of inner feeling fade and pass
there are no pomps to greet eiarine
our hearts reflect as a smoke darkened glass
when like a prison of crystal they should be
how each sharp hammer of the minster clock
cuts off a point of time until the bell
up carolling to the clouds with silvery swell
the sullen presage like a bird doth mock
but the day fleets and the shadow of the rock
falls opposite to where at morn it fell
the bees come home each to her angular cell
up to his hostel flies the roosting cock
now creep the beggars some with misery pined
to dungeon pits some where the woodland yields
small shelter thinned for comfortable fires
some to lone huts such as the shepherd builds
under a bank to shield him from the wind
in an old tree set round with thorns and briars
there sat a maiden neath a regal tower
girt with a forest of great oaks and pines
it seemed a lodge of some high conqueror
in the old days and round it creeping vines
grew wildly that no more men drank of now
and in the topmost arch there was a bell
that with the wind did vibrate vague and low
sped over the hills its modulated swell
palely she sat and at her side were things
of strange device to measure earth and stars
and a small quiet genius with his wings
upfolded and his eyes still fixed on hers
men uttered not her queenly name but she
had graved it in the dust melancoly
it is the winter sharp and suddenly
his angel frost hath breathed upon the land
tartuffe now at the chancel door doth stand
dispensing loaves from others' charity
and round about him come a hungry band
with piteous voice and asking eyes but he
a little backward sheltered from the wind
a book turns over for the church must be
maintained and therein all who are behind
with easter dues are writ it is poverty
moves them but duty stern his reverence
the loaves were given the church with pious mind
and justly they by wanting must be fined
although it grieves him till they pay their pence
the tide comes up the black and gusty river
slowly against it makes a boat its way
in the rough gale the bending sedges shiver
the dripping piles fling back the shattered spray
there is a church but none who come to pray
for it is a week day and made fast the door
but onward by a willow sheltered bay
hangs forth a sign more tempting to the boer
wild sing the breezes from the northern sea
flustering the topsails on the coast's low line
windly sings hans within the lattice he
is flustered too but it is with brantewein
see on the sands a wandering group appear
mynherr verkoop the pedlar and his gear
the black waves come in lashing the old walls
the shipless harbour from the shipless sea
the dreary wind sinks down at intervals
winter is here and yet it spring should be
chasing the snows with sweet regality
and the wild hills enamelling with flowers
that now the myrtle sore and pallidly
turning its branches from the salt spray showers
reigns over alone on yon deserted towers
an aloe grows but its tall bloom is dead
deep in his chink the bright green lizard cowers
sunshiny elf and fears the stranger's tread
rolling the loose stones down the steep but he
loves thee quaint creature and thy watchful head
to the short days and the great vault of shade
the whitener of the hills we come  alas
there is no colour in the faded grass
save the thick frost on its hoar stems arrayed
cold is it as a melancholy maid
the latest of the seasons now doth pass
with a dead garland in her icy glass
setting its spikes about her crispeacuted braid
the streams shall breathe along the orchards laid
in the soft spring time and the frozen mass
melt from the snow drift flowerets where it was
shoot up  the cuckoo shall delight the glade
but to new glooms through some obscure crevasse
she will have past  that melancholy maid
arise up england from the smoky cloud
that covers thee the din of whirling wheels
not the pale spinner prematurely bowed
by his hot toil alone the influence feels
of all this deep necessity for gain
gain still but deem not only by the strain
of engines on the sea and on the shore
glory that was thy birthright to retain
o thou that knewest not a conqueror
unchecked desires have multiplied in thee
till with their bat wings they shut out the sun
so in the dusk thou goest moodily
with a bent head as one who gropes for ore
heedless of living streams that round him run
not by aldobrandini's watery show
still plashing at his portal never dumb
minished of my devotion shalt thou come
leaving thy natural fount on algido
wild wingegraved daughter of the sabine snow
now creeping under quiet tusculum
now gushing from those caverns old and numb
dull were his heart who gazed upon thee so
emblem thou art of time memorial stream
which in ten thousand fancies being here
we waste or use or fashion as we deem
but if its backward voice comes ever near
as thine upon the hill how doth it seem
solemn and stern sepulchral and severe
when you shall see me in the toils of time
my lauded beauties carried off from me
my eyes no longer stars as in their prime
my name forgot of maiden fair and free
when in your being heart concedes to mind
and judgment though you scarce its process know
recalls the excellencies i once enshrined
and you are irked that they have withered so
remembering mine the loss is not the blame
that sportsman time but rears his brood to kill
knowing me in my soul the very same
one who would die to spare you touch of ill
will you not grant to old affection's claim
the hand of friendship down life's sunless hill
perhaps long hence when i have passed away
some other's feature accent thought like mine
will carry you back to what i used to say
and bring some memory of your love's decline
then you may pause awhile and think poor jade
and yield a sigh to me  as ample due
not as the tittle of a debt unpaid
to one who could resign her all to you
and thus reflecting you will never see
that your thin thought in two small words conveyed
was no such fleeting phantom thought to me
but the whole life wherein my part was played
and you amid its fitful masquerade
a thought  as i in your life seem to be
i will be faithful to thee aye i will
and death shall choose me with a wondering eye
that he did not discern and domicile
one his by right ever since that last good bye
i have no care for friends or kin or prime
of manhood who deal gently with me here
amid the happy people of my time
who work their love's fulfilment i appear
numb as a vane that cankers on its point
true to the wind that kissed ere canker came
despised by souls of now who would disjoint
the mind from memory making life all aim
my old dexterities in witchery gone
and nothing left for love to look upon
this love puts all humanity from me
i can but maledict her pray her dead
for giving love and getting love of thee
feeding a heart that else mine own had fed
how much i love i know not life not known
save as one unit i would add love by
but this i know my being is but thine own
fused from its separateness by ecstasy
and thus i grasp thy amplitudes of her
ungrasped though helped by rough regarding eyes
canst thou then hate me as an envier
who see unrecked what i so dearly prize
believe me lost one love is lovelier
the more it shapes its moan in selfish wise
if but some vengeful god would call to me
from up the sky and laugh thou suffering thing
know that thy sorrow is my ecstasy
that thy love's loss is my hate's profiting
then would i bear it clench myself and die
steeled by the sense of ire unmerited
half eased in that a powerfuller than i
had willed and meted me the tears i shed
but not so how arrives it joy lies slain
and why unblooms the best hope ever sown
crass casualty obstructs the sun and rain
and dicing time for gladness casts a moan
these purblind doomsters had as readily strown
blisses about my pilgrimage as pain
thy shadow earth from pole to central sea
now steals along upon the moon's meek shine
in even monochrome and curving line
of imperturbable serenity
how shall i link such sun cast symmetry
with the torn troubled form i know as thine
that profile placid as a brow divine
with continents of moil and misery
and can immense mortality but throw
so small a shade and heaven's high human scheme
be hemmed within the coasts yon arc implies
is such the stellar gauge of earthly show
nation at war with nation brains that teem
heroes and women fairer than the skies
you see those mothers squabbling there
remarks the man of the cemetery
one says in tears ''tis mine lies here'
another 'nay mine you pharisee'
another 'how dare you move my flowers
and put your own on this grave of ours'
but all their children were laid therein
at different times like sprats in a tin
and then the main drain had to cross
and we moved the lot some nights ago
and packed them away in the general foss
with hundreds more but their folks don't know
and as well cry over a new laid drain
as anything else to ease your pain
my bride is not coming alas says the groom
and the telegram shakes in his hand i own
it was hurried we met at a dancing room
when i went to the cattle show alone
and then next night where the fountain leaps
and the street of the quarter circle sweeps
ay she won me to ask her to be my wife
'twas foolish perhaps  to forsake the ways
of the flaring town for a farmer's life
she agreed and we fixed it now she says
it's sweet of you dear to prepare me a nest
but a swift short gay life suits me best
what i really am you have never gleaned
i had eaten the apple ere you were weaned
i walked in loamy wessex lanes afar
from rail track and from highway and i heard
in field and farmstead many an ancient word
of local lineage like thu bist er war
ich woll er sholl and by talk similar
nigh as they speak who in this month's moon gird
at england's very loins thereunto spurred
by gangs whose glory threats and slaughters are
then seemed a heart crying whosoever they be
at root and bottom of this who flung this flame
between folk kin tongued even as are we
sinister ugly lurid be their fame
may their familiars grow to shun their name
and their brood perish everlastingly
with outstretched whirring wings of van dyked jet
two crows one day o'er house and pavement pass'd
swift silhouettes limned 'gainst the blue they glass'd
smooth beak and ebon feather in the wet
of gaping pool and gutter while beset
by nestward longing high their hoarse cry cast
in the face of fickle sun and treacherous blast
till all the city smelt of violet
then through that city quick the news did run
great wheels were slacken'd belts were stopped in mill
and fires in forges long ere set of sun
dazed men pale women sought the open hill
they throng'd the streets they caught the clarion cry
spring has come back  trust spring to never die
strange that no idol hath been roughly wrought
or fairly carven bearing on its base
a name so potent strange no ancient race
workers in whitest parian ever sought
to reproduce thy beauty slyly fraught
with vast suggestion strange thou couldst not brace
the dull assyrian didst not tempt from chase
trophy and battle the sons of literal thought
we who are tired of gods must yet to thee
render allegiance chance and love are blind
and cause is soulless art is deaf and vain
all unavailing looms the god of pain
disclaiming these we choose with prescient mind
the unknown god of opportunity
the night breeze chill blew cold across the mere
the sullen mist slow creeping up the dale
enshrouded all the land with clammy veil
the clouds stood still the trees bent low with fear
at last far in the eastern heavens drear
a little stranger ray trembling and pale
afeared lest he to find his way should fail
took courage on the dismal scene to peer
the trees look up the grasses tip toe rear
their tiny heads the clouds mount up and scale
the topmost sky to gain an outlook clear
the waves awake aroused by rising gale
the mist shrinks back and all combine to hail
the dauntless little harbinger of cheer
our bark is on the waters wide around
the wandering wave above the lonely sky
hush a young sea bird floats and that quick cry
shrieks to the levelled weapon's echoing sound
grasp its lank wing and on with reckless bound
yet creature of the surf a sheltering breast
to night shall haunt in vain thy far off nest
a call unanswered search the rocky ground
lord of leviathan when ocean heard
thy gathering voice and sought his native breeze
when whales first plunged with life and the proud deep
felt unborn tempests heave in troubled sleep
thou didst provide even for this nameless bird
home and a natural love amid the surging seas
in the dim chamber whence but yesterday
passed my beloveacuted filled with awe i stand
and haunting loves fluttering on every hand
whisper her praises who is far away
a thousand delicate fancies glance and play
on every object which her robes have fanned
and tenderest thoughts and hopes bloom and expand
in the sweet memory of her beauty's ray
ah could that glass but hold the faintest trace
of all the loveliness once mirrored there
the clustering glory of the shadowy hair
that framed so well the dear young angel face
but no it shows my own face full of care
and my heart is her beauty's dwelling place
an hour agone and prostrate nature lay
like some sore smitten creature nigh to death
with feverish parched lips with labouring breath
and languid eyeballs darkening to the day
a burning noontide ruled with merciless sway
earth wave and air the ghastly stretching heath
the sullen trees the fainting flowers beneath
drooped hopeless shrivelling in the torrid ray
when like a sudden cheerful trumpet blown
far off by rescuing spirits rose the wind
urging great hosts of clouds the thunder's tone
breaks into wrath the rainy cataracts fall
but pausing lo behold creation shrined
in a new birth  god's covenant clasping all
the passionate summer's dead the sky's aglow
with roseate flushes of matured desire
the winds at eve are musical and low
as sweeping chords of a lamenting lyre
far up among the pillared clouds of fire
whose pomp of strange procession upward rolls
with gorgeous blazonry of pictured scrolls
to celebrate the summer's past renown
ah me how regally the heavens look down
o'ershadowing beautiful autumnal woods
and harvest fields with hoarded increase brown
and deep toned majesty of golden floods
that raise their solemn dirges to the sky
to swell the purple pomp that floateth by
too oft the poet in elaborate verse
flushed with quaint images and gorgeous tropes
casteth a doubtful light which is not hope's
on the dark spot where death hath sealed his curse
in monumental silence nature starts
indignant from the sacrilege of words
that ring so hollow and forlornly girds
her great woe round her there's no trick of art's
but shows most ghastly by a new made tomb
i see no balm in gilead he is lost
the beautiful soul that loved thee thy life's bloom
is withered by the sudden blighting frost
o grief how mighty creeds how vain ye are
earth presses closely  heaven is cold and far
upveiled in yonder dim ethereal sea
its airy towers the work of phantom spells
a viewless belfry tolls its wizard bells
pealed o'er this populous earth perpetually
some hear some hear them not but aye they be
laden with one strange note that sinks or swells
now dread as doom now gentle as farewells
time's dirge borne ever toward eternity
each hour in measured breath sobs out and dies
while the bell tolls its requiem  passing past
the sole sad burden of their long refrain
still with those hours each pang each pleasure flies
brief sweet brief bitter  all our days are vain
knolled into dread forgetfulness at last
i fear thee not o death nay oft i pine
to clasp thy passionless bosom to mine own
and on thy heart sob out my latest moan
ere lapped and lost in thy strange sleep divine
but much i fear lest that chill breath of thine
should freeze all tender memories into stone
lest ruthless and malign oblivion
quench the last spark that lingers on love's shrine
o god to moulder through dark dateless years
the while all loving ministries shall cease
and time assuage the fondest mourner's tears
here lies the sting  this this it is to die
and yet great nature rounds all strife with peace
and life or death each rests in mystery
life yielding fragrance of our mother earth
benignant breath exhaled from summer showers
all nature dimples into smiles of flowers
from unclosed woodland to trim garden girth
these perfumes softening the harsh soul of dearth
are older than old shinar's arrogant towers
and touched with visions of rain freshened hours
on syrian hill slopes ere the patriarch's birth
nay the charmed fancy plays a subtler part
lo banished adam his large wondering eyes
fixed on the trouble of the first dark cloud
lo tremulous eve  a pace behind how bowed
not dreaming 'midst her painful pants of heart
what balm shall fall from yonder ominous cloud
in youth when blood was warm and fancy high
i mocked at death how many a quaint conceit
i wove about his veiled head and feet
vaunting aloud why need we dread to die
but now enthralled by deep solemnity
death's pale phantasmal shade i darkly greet
ghostlike it haunts the hearth it haunts the street
or drearier makes drear midnight's mystery
ah soul perplexing vision oft i deem
that antique myth is true which pictured death
a masked and hideous form all shrank to see
but at the last slow ebb of mortal breath
death his mask melting like a nightmare dream
smiled  heaven's high priest of immortality
'tis solemn darkness the sublime of shade
night by no stars nor rising moon relieved
the awful blank of nothingness arrayed
o'er which my eye balls roll in vain deceived
upward around and downward i explore
e'en to the frontiers of the ebon air
but cannot though i strive discover more
than what seems one huge cavern of despair
oh night art thou so grim when black and bare
of moonbeams and no cloudlets to adorn
like a nude ethiop 'twixt two houris fair
thou stand'st between the evening and the morn
i took thee for an angel but have wooed
a cacodaemon in mine ignorant mood
how great unto the living seem the dead
how sacred solemn how heroic grown
how vast and vague as they obscurely tread
the shadowy confines of the dim unknown
for they have met the monster that we dread
have learned the secret not to mortal shown
e'en as gigantic shadows on the wall
the spirit of the daunted child amaze
so on us thoughts of the departed fall
and with phantasma fill our gloomy gaze
awe and deep wonder lend the living lines
and hope and ecstasy the borrowed beams
while fitful fancy the full form divines
and all is what imagination dreams
hushed in a calm beyond mine utterance
see in the western sky the evening spread
suspended in its pale serene expanse
like scattered flames the glowing cloudlets red
clear are those clouds and that pure sky's profound
transparent as a lake of hyaline
nor motion nor the faintest breath of sound
disturbs the steadfast beauty of the scene
far o'er the vault the winnowed welkin wide
from the bronzed east unto the whitened west
moored seem in their sweet tranquil roseate pride
those clouds the fabled islands of the blest
the lands where pious spirits breathe in joy
and love and worship all their hoiurs employ
the stars are glittering in the frosty sky
numerous as pebbles on a broad sea coast
and o'er the vault the cloud like galaxy
has marshalled its innumerable host
alive all heaven seems with wondrous glow
tenfold refulgent every star appears
as if some wide celestial gale did blow
and thrice illume the ever kindled spheres
orbs with glad orbs rejoicing burning beam
ray crowned with lambent lustre in their zones
till o'er the blue bespangled spaces seem
angels and great archangels on their thrones
a host divine whose eyes are sparkling gems
and forms more bright than diamond diadems
see how the morn awakes along the sky
proceeds she with her pale increasing light
and from the depths of the dim canopy
drives out the shadows of departing night
lo the clouds break and gradually more wide
morn openeth her bright rejoicing gates
and ever as the orient valves divide
a costlier aspect on their breadth awaits
lo the clouds break and in each opened schism
the coming phoebus lays huge beams of gold
and roseate fire and glories that the prism
would vainly strive before us to unfold
and while i gaze from out the bright abysm
a flaming disc is to the horizon rolled
'twas sabbath morn i lay 'neath pensive spell
and saw in reverie or waking dream
my life elapse in likeness of a stream
that in a slant and steady torrent fell
as if it gushed beneath the force supreme
of some high reservoir or lofty well
e'en such a stream i saw as from a bank
verdant with mosses and perpetual dank
i have observed leap forth when heavy rains
have through the uplands filtered fed earth's veins
to bursting this i saw with troubled eye
anticipating when the stream no more
in ceaseless crystalline cascade should pour
but sudden stop or slowly dribble dry
'twas on a day and in high radiant heaven
an angel lay beside a lake reclined
against whose shores the rolling waves were driven
and beat the measure to the dancing wind
there rapt he meditated on that story
of how jehovah did of yore expel
heaven's aborigines from grace and glory
those mighty angels that did dare rebel
and as he mused upon their dread abode
and endless penance from his drooping hands
his harp sank down and scattered all abroad
its rosy garland on the golden sands
his soul mute wondering that the all wise spirit
should have allowed the doom of such demerit

the lands where pious spirits breathe in joy
and love and worship all their hours employ
whither oh whither wilt thou wing thy way
what solemn region first upon thy sight
shall break unveiled for terror or delight
what hosts magificent in dread array
my spirit when thy prison house of clay
after long strife is rent fond fruitless quest
the unfledged bird within his narrow nest
sees but a few green branches oer him play
and through their parting leaves by fits revealed
a glimpse of summer sky nor knows the field
wherein his dormant powers must yet be tried
thou art that bird  of what beyond thee lies
far in the untracked immeasurable skies
knowing but this  that thou shalt find thy guide
how many blessed groups this hour are bending
through england's primrose meadow paths their way
towards spire and tower 'midst shadowy elms ascending
whence the sweet chimes proclaim the hallowed day
the halls from old heroic ages gray
pour their fair children forth and hamlets low
with those thick orchard blooms the soft winds play
send out their inmates in a happy flow
like a freed vernal stream i may not tread
with them those pathways to the feverish bed
of sickness bound yet o my god i bless
thy mercy that with sabbath peace hath filled
my chastened heart and all its throbbings stilled
to one deep calm of lowliest thankfulness
they float before my soul the fair designs
which i would body forth to life and power
like clouds that with their wavering hues and lines
portray majestic building  dome and tower
bright spire that through the rainbow and the shower
points to the unchanging stars and high arcade
far sweeping to some glorious altar made
for holiest rites
meanwhile the waning hour
melts from me and by fervent dreams overwrought
i sink o friend o linked with each high thought
aid me of those rich visions to detain
all i may grasp until thou seest fulfilled
while time and strength allow my hope to build
for lowly hearts devout but one enduring fane

the sky grown dull through many waiting days
flashed into crimson with the sunrise charm
so all my love aroused to vague alarm
flushed into fire and burned with eager blaze
i saw thee not as supplant with still gaze
of pleading but as victor  and thine arm
gathered me fast into embraces warm
and i was taught the light of love's dear ways
this day of triumph is no longer thine
o conqueror in calm exclusive power
as evermore through storm and shade and shine
your woe my pain your joy my ecstasy
we breathe together  so this blessed hour
of self surrender makes my jubilee
my god where is that ancient heat towards thee
wherewith whole shoals of martyrs once did burn
besides their other flames  doth poetry
wear venus' livery  only serve her turn
why are not sonnets made of thee  and lays
upon thine altar burnt  cannot thy love
heighten a spirit to sound out thy praise
as well as any she  cannot thy dove
outstrip their cupid easily in flight
or since thy ways are deep and still the fame
will not a verse run smooth that bears thy name
why doth that fire which by thy power and might
each breast does feel no braver fuel choose
than that which one day worms may chance refuse
sure lord there is enough in thee to dry
oceans of ink for as the deluge did
cover the earth so doth thy majesty
each cloud distills thy praise and doth forbid
poets to turn it to another use
roses and lilies speak thee and to make
a pair of cheeks of them is thy abuse
why should i women's eyes for crystal take
such poor invention burns in their low mind
whose fire is wild and doth not upward go
to praise and on thee lord some ink bestow
open the bones and you shall nothing find
in the best face but filth when lord in thee
the beauty lies in the discovery
as he that sees a dark and shady grove
stays not but looks beyond it on the sky
so when i view my sins mine eyes remove
more backward still and to that water fly
which is above the heav'ns whose spring and rent
is in my dear redeemer's pierced side
o blessed streams  either ye do prevent
and stop our sins from growing thick and wide
or else give tears to drown them as they grow
in you redemption measures all my time
and spreads the plaster equal to the crime
you taught the book of life my name that so
whatever future sins should me miscall
your first acquaintance might discredit all
prayer the church's banquet angels' age
god's breath in man returning to his birth
the soul in paraphrase heart in pilgrimage
the christian plummet sounding heav'n and earth
engine against th' almighty sinner's tower
reversed thunder christ side piercing spear
the six days' world transposing in an hour
a kind of tune which all things hear and fear
softness and peace and joy and love and bliss
exalted manna gladness of the best
heaven in ordinary man well dressed
the milky way the bird of paradise
church bells beyond the stars heard the soul's blood
the land of spices something understood
oh book  infinite sweetness  let my heart
suck ev'ry letter and a honey gain
precious for any grief in any part
to clear the breast to mollify all pain
thou art all health health thriving till it make
a full eternity  thou art a mass
of strange delights where we may wish and take
ladies look here this is the thankful glass
that mends the looker's eyes  this is the well
that washes what it shows  who can endear
thy praise too much thou art heav'n's lidger here
working against the states of death and hell
thou art joy's handsel heav'n lies flat in thee
subject to ev'ry mounter's bended knee
oh that i knew how all thy lights combine
and the configurations of their glory
seeing not only how each verse doth shine
but all the constellations of the story
this verse marks that and both do make a motion
unto a third that ten leaves off doth lie
then as dispersed herbs do match a potion
these three make up some christians' destiny
such are thy secrets which my life makes good
and comments on thee  for in ev'ry thing
thy words do find me out and parallels bring
and in another make me understood
stars are poor books and oftentimes do miss
this book of stars lights to eternal bliss
lord with what care hast thou begirt us round
parents first season us then schoolmasters
deliver us to laws they send us bound
to rules of reason holy messengers
pulpits and sundays sorrow dogging sin
afflictions sorted anguish of all sizes
fine nets and stratagems to catch us in
bibles laid open millions of surprises
blessings beforehand ties of gratefulness
the sound of glory ringing in our ears
without our shame within our consciences
angels and grace eternal hopes and fears
yet all these fences and their whole array
one cunning bosom sin blows quite away
lord how i am all ague when i seek
what i have treasured in my memory
since if my soul make even with the week
each seventh note by right is due to thee
i find there quarries of piled vanities
but shreds of holiness that dare not venture
to shew their face since cross to thy decrees
there the circumference earth is heav'n the center
in so much dregs the quintessence is small
the spirit and good extract of my heart
comes to about the many hundredth part
yet lord restore thine image hear my call
and though my hard heart scarce to thee can groan
remember that thou once didst write in stone
having been tenant long to a rich lord
not thriving i resolved to be bold
and make a suit unto him to afford
a new small rented lease and cancel th' old
in heaven at his manor i him sought
they told me there that he was lately gone
about some land which he had dearly bought
long since on earth to take possession
i straight returned and knowing his great birth
sought him accordingly in great resorts
in cities theatres gardens parks and courts
at length i heard a ragged noise and mirth
of thieves and murderers there i him espied
who straight your suit is granted said and died
wounded i sing tormented i indite
thrown down i fall into a bed and rest
sorrow hath chang'd its note  such is his will
who changeth all things as him pleaseth best
for well he knows if but one grief and smart
among my many had his full career
sure it would carry with it ev'n my heart
and both would run until they found a bier
to fetch the body both being due to grief
but he hath spoil'd the race and giv'n to anguish
one of joy's coats 'ticing it with relief
to linger in me and together languish
i live to shew his power who once did bring
my joys to weep and now my griefs to sing
let foreign nations of their language boast
what fine variety each tongue affords
i like our language as our men and coast
who cannot dress it well want with not words
how neatly do we give one only name
to parents' issue and the sun's bright star
a son is light and fruit a fruitful flame
chafing the father's dimness carried far
from the first man in th' east to fresh and new
western discov'ries of posterity
so in one word our lord's humility
we turn upon him in a sense most true
for what christ once in humbleness began
we him in glory call the son of man
all after pleasures as i rid one day
my horse and i both tir'd body and mind
with full cry of affections quite astray
i took up in the next inn i could find
there when i came whom found i but my dear
my dearest lord expecting till the grief
of pleasures brought me to him ready there
to be all passengers' most sweet relief
o thou whose glorious yet contracted light
wrapt in night's mantle stole into a manger
since my dark sould and brutish is thy right
to man of all beasts be not thou a stranger
furnish and deck my soul that thou mayst have
a better lodging than a rack or grave
my comforts drop and melt like snow
i shake my head and all the thoughts and ends
which my fierce youth did bandy fall and flow
like leaves about me or like summer friends
flies of estates and sun shine but to all
who think me eager hot and undertaking
but in my prosecutions slack and small
as a young exhalation newly waking
scorns his first bed of dirt and means the sky
but cooling by the way grows pursy and slow
and settling to a cloud doth live and die
in that dark state of tears to all that so
show me and set me i have one reply
which they that know the rest know more than i
black beauty which above that common light
whose power can no colours here renew
but those which darkness can again subdue
do'st still remain unvary'd to the sight
and like an object equal to the view
art neither chang'd with day nor hid with night
when all these colours which the world call bright
and which old poetry doth so persue
are with the night so perished and gone
that of their being there remains no mark
thou still abidest so intirely one
that we may know thy blackness is a spark
of light inaccessible and alone
our darkness which can make us think it dark
thou black wherein all colours are compos'd
and unto which they all at last return
thou colour of the sun where it doth burn
and shadow where it cools in thee is clos'd
whatever nature can or hath dispos'd
in any other hue from thee do rise
those tempers and complexions which disclos'd
as parts of thee do work as mysteries
of that thy hidden power when thou dost reign
the characters of fate shine in the skies
and tell us what the heavens do ordain
but when earth's common light shines to our eyes
thou so retir'st thyself that thy disdain
all revelation unto man denies
fatal aspect that hast an influence
more powerful far than those immortal fires
that but incline the will and move the sense
which thou alone contrain'st kindling desires
of such an holy force as more inspires
the soul with knowledge than experience
or revelation can do with all
their borrow'd helps sacred astonishment
sits on thy brow threatning a sudden fall
to all those thoughts that are not lowly sent
in wonder and amaze dazling that eye
which on those mysteries doth rudely gaze
vow'd only unto love's divinity
sure adam sinn'd not in that spotless face
regardful pretence whose fix'd majesty
darts admiration on the gazing look
that brings it not state sits inthron'd in thee
divulging forth her laws in the fair book
of thy commandements which none mistook
that ever humbly came therein to see
their own unworthiness oh how can i
enough admire that symmetry exprest
in new proportions which doth give the lie
to that arithmetique which hath profest
all numbers to be hers thy harmony
comes from the spheres and there doth prove
strange measures so well grac'd as majesty
itself like thee would rest like thee would move
exalted mind whose character doth bear
the first idea of perfection whence
adam's came and stands so how canst appear
in words that only tell what here
tofore hath been thou need'st as deep a sense
as prophecy since there's no difference
in telling what thou art and what shall be
then pardon me that rapture do profess
at thy outside that want for what i see
description if here amaz'd i cesse
thus
yet grant one question and no more crav'd under
thy gracious leave how if thou would'st express
thyself to us thou should'st be still a wonder
thus ends my love but this doth grieve me most
that so it ends but that ends too this yet
besides the wishes hopes and time i lost
troubles my mind awhile that i am set
free worse then denied i can neither boast
choice nor success as my case is nor get
pardon from myself that i loved not
a better mistress or her worse this debt
only's her due still that she be forgot
ere chang'd lest i love none this done the taint
of foul inconstancy is clear'd at least
in me there only rests but to unpaint
her form in my mind that so dispossest
it be a temple but without a saint
here lies king james who did so propagate
unto the world that blest and quiet state
wherein his subjects liv'd he seem'd to give
that peace which christ did leave and so did live
as once that king and shepherd of his sheep
that whom god saved here he seem'd to keep
till with that innocent and single heart
with which he first was crown'd he did depart
to better life great brittain to lament
that strangers more then thou may yet resent
the sad effects and while they feel the harm
they must endure from the victorious arm
of our king charles may they so long complain
that tears in them force thee to weep again
along my father's dykes i roam again
among the willows by the river side
these miles of green i know from hill to tide
and every creek and river's ruddy stain
neglected long and shunned our dead have lain
here where a people's dearest hope had died
alone of all their children scattered wide
i scan the sad memorials that remain
the dykes wave with the grass but not for me
the oxen stir not while this stranger calls
from these new homes upon the green hill side
where speech is strange and a new people free
no voice cries out in welcome for these halls
give food and shelter where i may not bide
from the soft dyke road crooked and wagon worn
comes the great load of rustling scented hay
slow drawn with heavy swing and creaky sway
through the cool freshness of the windless morn
the oxen yoked and sturdy horn to horn
sharing the rest and toil of night and day
bend head and neck to the long hilly way
by many a season's labour marked and torn
on the broad sea of dyke the gathering heat
waves upward from the grass where road on road
is swept before the tramping of the teams
and while the oxen rest beside the sweet
new hay the loft receives the early load
with hissing stir among the dusty beams
dean bourn farewell i never look to see
dean or thy warty incivility
thy rocky bottom that doth tear thy streams
and makes them frantic ev'n to all extremes
to my content i never should behold
were thy streams silver or thy rocks all gold
rocky thou art and rocky we discover
thy men and rocky are thy ways all over
o men o manners now and ever known
to be a rocky generation
a people currish churlish as the seas
and rude almost as rudest savages
with whom i did and may re sojourn when
rocks turn to rivers rivers turn to men
for brave comportment wit without offence
words fully flowing yet of influence
thou art that man of men the man alone
worthy the public admiration
who with thine own eyes read'st what we do write
and giv'st our numbers euphony and weight
tell'st when a verse springs high how understood
to be or not born of the royal blood
what state above what symmetry below
lines have or should have thou the best canst show
for which my charles it is my pride to be
not so much known as to be loved by thee
long may i live so and my wreath of bays
be less another's laurel than thy praise
i saw her once  o taunting destiny
the paths of life then drew our steps apart
yet still that swift and softly loosened dart
lies quiv'ring in my breast and i must be
a gazer on the glass of memory
a silent watcher o'er my wounded heart
how oft from dreams of liberty i start
and wake  alas the chain still fetters me
life gave its sweetest gift  ah wherefore weep
a cruel boon perchance yet in my mind
the cold perfections of her beauty keep
a loveliness that words can never bind
the seed was sown and now my thoughts do reap
a harvest where no chaff is left behind
softer than silence stiller than still air
float down from high pine boughs the slender leaves
the forest floor its annual boon receives
that comes like snowfall tireless tranquil fair
gently they glide gently they clothe the bare
old rocks with grace their fall a mantle weaves
of paler yellow than autumnal sheaves
or those strange blossoms the witch hazels wear
athwart long aisles the sunbeams pierce their way
high up the crows are gathering for the night
the delicate needles fill the air the jay
takes through their golden mist his radiant flight
they fall and fall till at november's close
the snow flakes drop as lightly  snows on snows
my baby sits beneath the tall elm trees
a wreath of tangled ribbons in her hands
she twines and twists the many coloured strands
a little sorceress weaving destinies
now the pure white she grasps now naught can please
but strips of crimson lurid as the brands
from passion's fires or yellow like the sands
that lend soft netting to the azure seas
and so with sweet incessant toil she fills
a summer hour still following fancies new
till through my heart a sudden terror thrills
lest as she weaves her aimless choice prove true
thank god our fates proceed not from our wills
the power that spins the thread shall blend the hue
quickly and pleasantly the seasons blow
over the meadows of eternity
as wave on wave the pulsings of the sea
merge and are lost each in the other's flow
time is no lover it is only he
that is the one unconquerable foe
he is the sudden tempest none can know
winged with swift winds that none may hope to flee
fair child of loveliness these endless fears
are nought to us let us be gods of stone
and set our images beyond the years
on some high mount where we can be alone
and thou shalt ever be as now thou art
and i shall watch thee with untroubled heart
the golden spring redeems the withered year
and wherefore should my spirit be afraid
though autumn winds wail through the smoky shade
and chill me like the fleeting ghost of fear
sweet love of youth i know that thou must fade
i know what nameless spectres hover near
and that the loveliness i hold so dear
borrowed from dust to ashes must be paid
yet linger still over these wasted meadows
faint shreds of song and scattered scents of flowers
and from the heart's abyss of deepening shadows
rise the young passions of immortal hours
the golden spring its withered year redeems
sleep comes at last but sleep made rich with dreams
then judge me as thou wilt i cannot flee
i cannot turn away from thee forever
for there are bonds that wisdom cannot sever
and slaves with souls far freer than the free
such strong desires the universal giver
with unknown plan has buried deep in me
that the passionate joy of watching thee
has dominated all my life's endeavor
thou weariest of having me so near
i feel the scorn thou hast within thy heart
and yet the face has never seemed so dear
as now when i am minded to depart
though thou shalt drive me hence i love thee so
that i shall watch thee when thou dost not know
to make my days impatient with unrest
to filch the quiet of the dark's repose
seeking forever what my soul well knows
is ever far beyond my farthest quest
so this is love swift joys and lingering woes
a wistful kiss beneath the ashen west
farewell and greeting mouth to mouth once pressed
and then the empty darkness onward flows
the heights that i have won do not endure
they shrink beneath the stars i yearn to win
the triumphs of my passion only lure
my vagrant feet to tread the verge of sin
though well i know that when i fall thereover
love will fly hence the loved one and the lover
i cannot yet admit unchecked despair
since now my heart this unknown conflict wages
i know not what the endless strife presages
i dare not welcome hope nor exile care
for love with fear and hope with grief engages
and i the burden of the battle bear
friends there are none foes i have everywhere
hope lies grief stabs and still the combat rages
and thou sweet monarch of my love hast wrought
this ruin on my land of venily
and sown rebellion in my humblest thought
making my dreams deal traitorously with me
but stay i would not that this struggle cease
for having thee is better far than peace
how should i think of thee but with delight
how should i greet thy face but with a smile
and yet dark tears within my heart defile
the dreams of thee that i would have so bright
if thou shouldst come and end this lonely while
these leaden hours of the sleepless night
still should i fear to show thee what i write
lest i repent in vain and thou revile
yet couldst thou read these scriptures of my heart
graven in passion with no base control
for one brief moment then they might impart
some almost worthy offering from my soul
i write for thee and cannot let thee read
thus love denies itself its utmost need
how strange it is that thine ethereal grace
should make me sorry by its loveliness
for surely beauty is designed to bless
those hours of youth that have so short a race
and yet the memory of some old distress
shadows me over when i see thy face
and yearning ever for one swift embrace
has tinged my joy in thee with bitterness
the young smiles flashing brightly free and fair
the laughing stars that in thy deep eyes shine
it is not love for me that lights them there
i see their beauty but they are not mine
thy loveliness is joy poisoned with pain
rapture to love torment to love in vain
the rising deluges of circumstance
have flooded all the gardens of my dreams
no more the inner sun of gladness gleams
upon pale flowers of a lover's trance
dear love i know not why this torrent seems
to drown in turbid billowings of chance
the blossoms of thy visioned countenance
soiling my richest thoughts with earthy streams
the river of the world is ever strong
i would that i could leave this doubtful shore
and yet i linger hoping that ere long
the swirling tide will crush my dreams no more
and if my gardens ever bloom again
how fair will be thy perfect blossom then
i love devoutly thou shalt seek for long
ere thou receive another offering
such as these passionate tributes that i bring
with all the deep submission of the strong
i would that all my chants of thee could ring
through the great sorrows of the nameless throng
and that thy beauty echoing in my song
could wake the weary city into spring
since thou hast changed my life and in my heart
hast deep implanted this new love of life
perchance these phantoms of thee will impart
beauty and courage to a world at strife
and yet i tarry long in fear to share
with common men a song of one so fair
let those who love hear me i speak as one
who hath known every portion of love's pain
and all the swift delights that flare and wane
between the setting and the rising sun
sins have i known whose sweetness left no stain
and virtues that much villainy have done
but now the pattern that my heart has spun
is finished and i see that it is vain
vain is the virgin kiss and vain the thought
that binds the heart's desire from afar
each loves the image his own mind has wrought
each worships no true spirit but a star
by none is this believed until the years
reveal the sad deception and with tears
we have come back to one another yes
after long languishing in spheres apart
thou hast returned since love's own self thou art
and i in penitence and fearfulness
o gentle love that leaves me not to smart
forever in the clutches of distress
when with a kindly pardon thou canst bless
consummately my long disconsolate heart
forgive me yet again if to this joy
i do not rise at once from melancholy
mine was the utmost sin thus to destroy
our calm devotion with unbridled folly
bear with me yet awhile until i prove
the tenderness of all repentant love
i will fling wide the windows of my soul
under the deep hush of nocturnal skies
when the white legions of the stars arise
and write their secrets on the master's scroll
i will go forth and watch with slumberous eyes
the languid billows of the ocean roll
in silver rhythms on some hidden shoal
swelling with laughter falling back with sighs
and in the tranquil twilight of that place
the lovely solitude of lonely sands
will flash the pale resplendence of thy grace
in sudden beauty out of other lands
and i will kneel and kiss thine ivory hands
beneath the flowered music of thy face
poor faltering lines my weary soul's relief
the balm of passion opiate of pain
a mightier hand than mine a mightier brain
had wrought in you an immemorial grief
but though my love and art both prove in vain
wither and die with me i had as lief
that it were so respite however brief
is all sufficient to the living slain
for separate voices sink at eventide
and none survives the creeping hush of time
nought lives but life the fame of them that died
brings back no vestige of their lovely prime
fame and oblivion shall merge again
in nameless loves and laughter tears and pain
let all men see the ruins of the shrine
that i with passionate and holy care
built long ago from laughter and despair
that godly love might have a fane divine
let the wide wings of darkness hover where
the god of youth once drank his rarest wine
and let the rank breath of some poisoned vine
choke the last sigh that lingers on the air
hurl the white sanctuary down and bare
its inmost secrets to the gaze of men
unveil the altar to the vulgar stare
and let none seek it build it up agin
ah when the last wall crumbles stone by stone
i shall go hence that i may weep alone
how oft the traitor trumpet sounds retreat
beguiling my bewildered soul again
when all the forces on the battle plain
are ready to do homage at my feet
and when i fight with strength it is in vain
for then i find no foe before my eyes
they lurk in shadow waiting to surprise
my soul when it is weary and in pain
how shall i gauge the conflict and the odds
misled and blinded in the midst of strife
how shall i know mine enemy o gods
grant me one moment worthy of my life
to see at last beyond the dust and shade
and face real foemen strong and unafraid
even as love grows more i write the less
impelled to speak unable still to voice
the lyric thoughts like angels that rejoice
attendant on thy godly loveliness
stay the bright swallow high in airy poise
carve out of stone an infinite caress
garner the fruits of tears and happiness
make bloom forever what an hour destroys
then shamed by such unprecedented skill
i may find words to name thee and to sing
such praises of thy beauty as shall fill
the listening world with floods of carolling
till then thou art like starlight on the air
or clouds at dawn unutterably fair
voice that art life to me i almost hear
thy sweet familiar cadence on the breeze
at times a far call infinitely clear
face that art love to me my spirit sees
in each unfolding bud of the young year
imperfect shadows of thy grace appear
for thou dear one art fairer than all these
soul that art part of me at last i know
what murmurs on the wakening breezes blow
what hand of ivory pours out the wine
filling the cup of spring to overflow
all beauty mirrors what is only thine
and thou the source not mortal but divine
lovely art thou and everything of thine
reflects the glory of thy noble grace
that thou shouldst have returned my swift embrace
has made me feel that i too am divine
my spirit met thy spirit face to face
thy godlike heart has not rejected mine
and i have been uplifted in the shrine
and high exalted in the holy place
think not that thou or i shall ever fade
forgotten in the silence of the years
we are but one this world of myth and shade
shall not appall us with its dusty fears
if death should find the hearts whom love hath kissed
we never met and nothing doth exist
although the spring is hastening to pursue
the swift white deer of winter through the glades
sometimes they pause for breath beneath the shades
then blows the frozen hurricane anew
and so the chill of thy neglect invades
my heart in which of late a timid few
flowers began to spring until there blew
this sudden storm blighting the tender blades
but when april at last shall put to flight
the pallid cohorts of the lingering snow
and every leaf lifts upward to the light
and every spirit blossoms from its woe
ah then relent and let me have my share
of joy and rise up radiant from care
to walk beside the river in the dawn
is fair indeed when spring is in the breeze
bird carollings the mumbling hum of bees
sing matins from the dew bespangled lawn
and dancing there behind those druid trees
lurks in delight a little singing faun
who laughs at us and yet is always gone
when we would trace his scattered melodies
alone dear love with thee and the new day
now am i radiant like the golden fields
no distant longing and no dim dismay
nought but the gladness that the hour yields
to walk beside the river is most fair
when love is young and spring is in the air
two lovers stood alone beneath the night
and quickened with a sudden strength one said
to night is ours to snatch from out the dead
an immortality of vast delight
when youth has felt the touch of time and fled
when love in chill despair has taken flight
there is one joy that knows not change nor blight
ah kiss me ere the fleeting hour be sped
the hovering moon leaned low in rapt desire
two souls uprose beyond oblivion
a shout triumphal shook the starry choir
then sacred silence fell until the sun
gazed like a victor as he gazes now
on the new day and the undying vow
fly joyous wind through all the wakened earth
now when the portals of the dawn outpour
laughter and radiant sunlight from the store
of spring's glad passion and loud ringing mirth
cry to the world that i despair no more
heart greets my heart and hope has proved its worth
fly where the meadows swell in flowery birth
chant everywhere and everywhere adore
circle the basking hills in fragrant flight
shout rapture rapture if sweet sorrow passes
and whisper low in intimate delight
my love song to the undulating grasses
grief is no more love rises with the spring
o fly free wind and rapture rapture sing
over the waters but a single bough
stretches in silhouette against the moon
the little dark waves haunt the dim lagoon
and splash against the languid moving prow
i should have left thee when the afternoon
surrendered to pursuing night for now
too perilously dear and fair art thou
and love too soon invoked shall die too soon
i fear the very floods of happiness
that swell the narrow chambers of my heart
knowing indeed that with our first caress
contentment and my soul forever part
o night of love and beauty all the years
shall pay for thy brief ecstasy with tears
there was a boy in some forgotten spring
who fled from all his comrades at the school
and in the hills beside a forest pool
lay on the grass watching and listening
and as he listened melancholy delight
stirred in his heart a pang he did not know
and voices of new passion bade him write
of the vague thoughts that shook his spirit so
now on the battlefield of later times
i meet those dreams returning in the forms
of mighty friends and foes amid the strife
and reading those imperfect boyish rhymes
i hear through the blown dust of many storms
the hymns of the advance guard of my life
now would that thou wert here my happiness
here in the flesh or else completely gone
out of my life out of my thoughts withdrawn
and memory clean of love and old distress
night dreams in pain of thee and on that lawn
where we would sit at eventide and press
heart against heart only white loneliness
stretches beneath the winter's cheerless dawn
thou woundest me with absence all the air
seems echoing thy name and through the day
i woo forgetfulness but unaware
my thoughts return to our farewell caress
now would that thou wert here my happiness
joy dwells with thee and thou art far away
what though the night be dissonant with rain
and roofs drip in a mournful monotone
on the deserted streets and breezes moan
over the naked boughs like ghosts in pain
yet are there voices through the darkness blown
from some remote celestial domain
that hint of peace and scatter all the vain
questions that mock the soul brooding alone
all nights are beautiful but in the warm
wet darkness that knows neither stars nor moon
whose bells half heard through the complaining storm
bind the wind's discords in harmonious tune
the soul withdraws into its cave of rest
and dreams long dreams well loved but not expressed
about the headlands and the rocky shoals
i hear the breath of twilight sighing sighing
and over the wail and dash of breakers crying
the voices of old ships and wandering souls
through the wet air squadrons of gulls are flying
wheeling but once against the skies then tossed
into the wind like a flight of visions lost
with vanished souls into the darkness dying
o harp of the winds singing above the dead
o rush of wings over the turbulent deep
pray for the spirits uncompanioned
the dreams returned into oblivion
the men drifting far from the stars and sun
lost in a lonely night and a loveless sleep
the insurgent sea sweeps through the barrier
triumphant all its foaming strength amassed
in one tempestuous tide wallowing past
the broken banks and the worn dykes that were
upbuilt by coward hearts sated at last
it settles in calm pools about the bar
so that at twilight the young evening star
beholds its image in still waters cast
against unyielding shores i too have striven
and won at last like the uprising sea
and sink to rest beneath a quiet heaven
after long struggles a long victory
but my star vanishes its light withdrawn
and darkness falls unpromising of dawn
speak not of waning love and changing days
youth may be short and life may not endure
yet with a strength unslacked a vision sure
my love companions thee in all thy ways
whither thou wanderest in times unsure
of peace however far thy spirit strays
from love of me my spirit ever stays
close to thy side and there shall rest secure
if thou shouldst weary of me and alone
i walked with grief yet should i be aware
how far unworthy i had been to share
in thy diviner life or sing thy praise
if thou shouldst hate me yet i am thine own
speak not of waning love and changing days
who follows love shall walk in outland places
beyond the common cheer of hall and town
he shall forget all things the friendly faces
the strife for wealth the struggle for renown
a young crusader putting by his crown
a pilgrim following a holy vision
heeding nor threat of king nor gibe of clown
the tyrant's hatred nor the world's derision
thus shall he wander in no bright elysian
meadows shall be his quest but through the vast
and midnight fears that shake his heart's decision
with staring madness till he see at last
like parsifal in ages long ago
love's flaming chalice out of darkness glow
only last night we dwelt together we
whose lips the ultimate farewells enthrall
last night itself is but a stone let fall
into the chasm of eternity
there shall be echoes i shall hear them call
however faint however far they be
there shall be shadows i shall always see
them beckon from time's memory haunted hall
the drear mirages of the years gone by
glow falsely golden from their dark domain
but now they stir me not  mere mockery
low to my heart i say to still its pain
and cloud built cities in the sunset sky
fade out in dark across the endless plain
thou only wert my hope and thou art gone
thou the one star in monotones of sky
art vanished like a meteor and i
lost in the night have ceased to pray for dawn
i watched thee fade i saw thee passing by
and tried to call thee but my lips were dumb
it had been better hadst thou never come
remembered riches mock my poverty
blow from afar the little sounds of bells
wood smoke hangs thinly on the autumn air
the town's unconscious hush is like a prayer
and night sleeps pleasantly among the dells
i only wander on and know not where
through the great dark pursued by faint farewells
if in some fair elysian seclusion
we yet shall find the dreams that we have wrought
to guide our souls while the dark strife is fought
amongst these shades moving in black confusion
if with our finite sorrows we have bought
infinite joy safe from the world's intrusion
and in this wilderness of blind delusion
have sought one vision worthy to be sought
then we are not irrevocably parted
but fighting upward each in his own fashion
from mortal dust to an immortal passion
separate in earthly chance yet single hearted
we that in steep and lonely paths have trod
at dawn shall meet before the face of god
long after both of us are scattered dust
and alien souls perchance shall read of thee
guessing the passions that have crushed from me
these poor confessions of my love and trust
ah well i know how heartless they will be
for some will laugh and others more unjust
whose minds know not of love but only lust
will stain the vesture of our memory
and yet a few there may be who will feel
my true devotion and my deep desires
and know that these unhappy lines reveal
only new images in changeless fires
and they indeed will linger with a sigh
to think that beauty such as thine must die
two souls there are in nature and in life
the soul of beauty and the soul of truth
towards which we yearn and strain with restless strife
along paths fraught with malice or with ruth
in the red face of ridicule and scorn
men sought and still must seek these  for within
in spite of all earth's sorrow and her sin
the soul is to the search and manner born
and still in looking beauty in the face
with strong prophetic joy we recognise
something of what we may be as we trace
our own dim shadow in her lustrous eyes
nor may we part such with a dull harsh rule
beauty is true and truth is beautiful
the shannon bore me to thy bosom wide
i wandered with it on its winding way
by fields of yellow corn and new mown hay
and far blue hills that rose on either side
and low dark woods that fringed the ebbing tide
and ever as its waters neared the west
out of the slumber of its broadening breast
faint momentary ripples rose and died
and rose again before the breeze and grew
to wavelets dancing in the noonday light
and these were changed to waves of ocean blue
and creek and headland faded from the sight
and oh at last  at last i floated free
on the long rollers of the open sea
oh once again upon thy heaving breast
i floated like a seabird when it braves
the shoreward onset of thy flowing waves
and leaps triumphant on each rushing crest
round me in dark magnificent unrest
the billows of the wild atlantic rolled
far far away into the gates of gold
the sunlit portals of the stormy west
o never wearied in the hush of noon
thy billows break the paths of golden sleep
they break the dreamlike lustre of the moon
earth knows the hours of darkness thou dost keep
eternal vigil still thy surges white
flash through the deepest gloom of starless night
trained in the holy art whose lifted shield
wards off the darts a never slumbering foe
by hearth and wayside lurking waits to throw
oppression taught his helpful arm to wield
the slayer's weapon on the murderous field
the fiery bolt he challenged laid him low
seeking its noblest victim even so
the charter of a nation must be sealed
the healer's brow the hero's honours crowned
from lowliest duty called to loftiest deed
living the oak leaf wreath his temples bound
dying the conqueror's laurel was his meed
last on the broken ramparts' turf to bleed
where freedom's victory in defeat was found
young beautiful and learned jane intent
on knowledge found it peace her vast acquirement
of goodness was her fall she was content
with dulcet pleasures such as calm retirement
yields to the wise alone  her only vice
was virtue in obedience to her sire
and lord she died with them a sacrifice
to their ambition her own mild desire
was rather to be happy than be great
for though at their request she claimed the crown
that they through her might rise to rule the state
yet the bright diadem and gorgeous throne
she viewed as cares dimming the dignity
of her unsullied mind and pure benignity
there is a silence where hath been no sound
there is a silence where no sound may be
in the cold grave  under the deep deep sea
or in the wide desert where no life is found
which hath been mute and still must sleep profound
no voice is hushed  no life treads silently
but clouds and cloudy shadows wander free
that never spoke over the idle ground
but in green ruins in the desolate walls
of antique palaces where man hath been
thoughl the dun fox or wild hyaena calls
and owls that flit continually between
shriek to the echo and the low winds moan
there the true silence is self conscious and alone
it is not death that sometime in a sigh
this eloquent breath shall take its speechless flight
that sometime these bright stars that now reply
in sunlight to the sun shall set in night
that this warm conscious flesh shall perish quite
and all life's ruddy springs forget to flow
that thoughts shall cease and the immortal sprite
be lapped in alien clay and laid below
it is not death to know this  but to know
that pious thoughts which visit at new graves
in tender pilgrimage will cease to go
so duly and so oft  and when grass waves
over the past away there may be then
no resurrection in the minds of men
the world is with me and its many cares
its woes  its wants  the anxious hopes and fears
that wait on all terrestrial affairs
the shades of former and of future years
forboding fancies and prophetic tears
quelling a spirit that was once elate
heavens what a wilderness the world appears
where youth and mirth and health are out of date
but no  a laugh of innocence and joy
resounds like music of the fairy race
and gladly turning from the world's annoy
i gaze upon a little radiant face
and bless internally the merry boy
who makes a son shine in a shady place
she was a woman peerless in her station
with household virtues wedded to her name
spotless in linen grass bleached in her fame
and pure and clear starched in her conversation
thence in my castle of imagination
she dwells for evermore the dainty dame
to keep all airy draperies from shame
and all dream furnitures in preservation
there walketh she with keys quite silver bright
in perfect hose and shoes of seemly black
apron and stomacher of lily white
and decent order follows in her track
the burnished plate grows lustrous in her sight
and polished floors and tables shine her back
i had a gig horse and i called him pleasure
because on sundays for a little jaunt
he was so fast and showy quite a treasure
although he sometimes kicked and shied aslant
i had a chaise and christened it enjoyment
with yellow body and the wheels of red
because it was only used for one employment
namely to go wherever pleasure led
i had a wife her nickname was delight
a son called frolic who was never still
alas how often dark succeeds to bright
delight was thrown and frolic had a spill
enjoyment was upset and shattered quite
and pleasure fell a splitter on paine's hill
along the woodford road there comes a noise
of wheels and mr rounding's neat post chaise
struggles along drawn by a pair of bays
with reverend mr crow and six small boys
who ever and anon declare their joys
with trumping horns and juvenile huzzas
at going home to spend their christmas days
and changing learning's pains for pleasure's toys
six weeks elapse and down the woodford way
a heavy coach drags six more heavy souls
but no glad urchins shout no trumpets bray
the carriage makes a halt the gate bell tolls
and little boys walk in as dull and mum
as six new scholars to the deaf and dumb
the world is charged with the grandeur of god
it will flame out like shining ftorn shook foil
it gathers to a greatness like the ooze of oil
crushed why do men then now not reck his rod
generations have trod have trod have trod
and all is seared with trade bleared smeared with toil
and wears man's smudge and shares man's smell the soil
is bare now nor can foot feel being shod
and for all this nature is never spent
there lives the dearest freshness deep down things
and though the last lights off the black west went
oh morning at the brown brink eastward springs
because the holy ghost over the bent
world broods with warm breast and with ah bright wings
nothing is so beautiful as spring
when weeds in wheels shoot long and lovely and lush
thrush's eggs look little low heavens and thrush
through the echoing timber does so rinse and wring
the ear it strikes like lightnings to hear him sing
the glassy peartree leaves and blooms they brush
the descending blue that blue is all in a rush
with richness the racing lambs too have fair their fling
what is all this juice and all this joy
a strain of the earth's sweet being in the beginning
in eden garden  have get before it cloy
before it cloud christ lord and sour with sinning
innocent mind and mayday in girl and boy
most o maid's child thy choice and worthy the winning
the moon that borrows now a gentle light
once burned another sun then from on high
the earth received a double day the sky
showed but faint stars and never knew a night
the poles now frigid and for ever white
with the deep snows that on their bosoms lie
were torrid as the moon that hung thereby
and mingled rays as fiercely hot as bright
mutations infinite through shifting sea
and lands huge monstrous beasts once took their range
where now our stately world shows pleasantly
then be not fearful at the thought of change
for though unknown the times that are to be
yet shall they prove most beautifully strange
i ofttimes see her face here in the gloom
when  dreaming by my fire as dreamers dream
i watch the flickering fire lights till they seem
like magic shuttles on a shadowy loom
to weave strange pictures in the dusky room
for her face 'mid the others there i find
it thrills me with a sense all undefined
vague as the fragrance of an old perfume
her hair  the light that shimmers on the sea
her wistful mouth  a red bud not half blown
her tender eyes  a cloudless summer sky
flash on my sight a glimpse of rapture nigh
then fade away and leave me here alone
her heart  but love himself holds that in fee
when we are dead i firmly do believe
we shall slip back into the primal sea
of the universal life that there shall be
no such false joys as on this earth deceive
nay nor no truer ones  nor cause to grieve
nor terror nor despite nor mockery
nor love life's strongest bitterest mystery
and while we still are struggling in the strife
surely it is a gracious boon though small
that one brief sweet real joy at least there is
to be about to die and know that all
the anguish and the agony of life
will not last longer than a lover's kiss
if thou canst not from some superior sphere
look down upon this world that gave thee birth
or from some glad abode of stingless mirth
bend hitherward thy godbright head to hear
some rainbow winged etherial messenger
tell thee men worship now thy wondrous worth
if thou art not having passed away from earth
if thou whose name all sons of song revere
art nothing but the shadow of a name
if through the whole allotted period
of thy brief life thou were allowed to dwell
in endless bitter ignorance of thy fame
then must we yield it that there is no god
or else that he is crueller than hell
all too grotesque our thoughts are sometimes odd
that there will come a day when you and i
shall not be you and i that we shall lie
we two  i' the damp earth mould  above each clod
a drunken headstone in the neglected sod
thereon the phrase hic jacet carved awry
and then our virtues bah and piety
perhaps some cheeky reference to god
and haply after many a century
some spectacled old man shall drive the birds
a moment from their song i' the lonely spot
and make a copy of the quaint old words
they will then be quaint and old  and all for what
to fill a gap in a genealogy
i sometimes long to throw my books away
and to forget the thoughts that make me sad
the mighty musings that have ever clad
the minds of men in chill and sombre grey
i sometimes long to laugh out and be gay
as some blithe thoughtless merry hearted lad
or wander in the forest and be glad
without a memory of a heavier day
yet when i try to turn myself apart
from all the deeper mysteries of life
in nature love and hate of human strife
still the same thoughts throng through my throbbing brain
and i arise in heaviness of heart
and turn me to my studying again
it stood upon the hill like some old chief
and held communion with the cryptic wind
keeping like some dim unforgotten grief
the memory of the tribesmen autumn skinned
silent and slow as clouds whose footing passed
down the remote trails of oblivion
long since into the caverns of the past
alone aloof strong fellow of the sun
we chose it for our standard in its prime
nor  though no longer grimly from its hill
it fronts the world like webster  wind nor time
has felled its austere ghost we see it still
in alien lands resurgent and undying
flag of our hearts from sudden ramparts flying
mourn we who honored him but knew him not
grieve ye who loved him looking on his face
be mindful dartmouth of each strenuous trace
that keeps his loyal record unforgot
there is no faithlessness in grief god wot
however high the hope or clear the gaze
there must be tears at every burial place
though through the tears the very sky be shot
for death is like the passing of a star
that melts into the splendor of the dawn
were we beyond the air that blurs our sight
in the clear ether where the angels are
we should behold it still but now withdrawn
in sunrise lose it looking on the light
love is eternal sang i long ago
of some light love that lasted for a day
but when the fleeting fancy passed away
and other loves that following made as though
they were the very deathless lost the glow
youth mimics the divine with and grew gray
i said it is a dream no love will stay
angels have taught me wisdom now i know
though lesser loves and greater loves may cease
love still endures knocking at myriad gates
that lead to god  stars winds and waters birds
beasts flowers and men  speaking its sweetest words
at woman's portal till it finds its peace
in the abyss where godhead loves and waits
as one of those huge monsters of the sky
fierce with the flame of fiery floating hair
falls from the zenith through the upper air
hurling the planets from their paths on high
jarring creation from its harmony
spreading on earth destruction and despair
terrifying men to the temples and vain prayer
so from the summit of his majesty
he fails and heaven is shaken as flame zeus reigns
usurping and no matter what is left
how smooth or tangled grows his god life's weft
with how swift footing or how slow the years
speed on for him forever there remains
a thunder and a chaos in the spheres
poet thou art to me a faery king
dwelling in some weird place of witchery
some garden where unnumbered roses vie
in color with the hollyhocks that spring
on every side in scarlet wantoning
and lilies'neath the gaudier herbage lie
and violets unclose their leaves near by
while stately sunflowers guard each opening
and in that garden realm magnificent
i often see thee walking stopping now
to list to hollow murmurs now to scent
some flower's subtle perfume wherein pent
a rich rare pleasance lies that none but thou
and thy strange fellow bard the wind can know
oft too i see thee on the rocky shore
worshipping all the infinitely strong
grand godhead that to ocean doth belong
or prostrate with uncovered head before
the sun whom even ocean doth adore
who giveth speech to every poet's tongue
who is the only king and god of song
from whom all bards receive their secret lore
for thou art brother of the elements
there is a spirit of kinship that compels
your feet to stray in paths where nothing dwells
save the triune power that knows not death nor birth
but sways all nature in omnipotence
sea wind and sun the gods who rule the earth
i also standing where the white caps seem
in inextinguishable laughter on the shore
forever tumbling and where glancing o'er
the sandy beach the sun god's arrows gleam
bright as the swords of eden's cherubim
here on this coast mind seen of bards of your
atlantis the lost world now found once more
this land whereof the hellene did dream
i cast this sea shell into the great sea
and all the old greek spirit in me prays
to great poseidon whom we both adore
to cast it up upon the other shore
where it may meet thine apollonian gaze
and murmur sweetlier being seen of thee
these college days of jollity and mirth  how pleasurable are they and how serene
just tinged with sorrow enough to welcome in
with heartier joy all wassail that gives birth
to bliss that lifts the spirit from the earth
shall not this book and the signatures herein
of men whose friendship i am glad to win
years hence recall this time that knows no dearth
of ready jests and sunshine of sweet lays
and vintages of xeres and the rhine
ah the remembrance of these happy days
the music and the laughter and the wit
the cups that smile with glimmering of sweet wine
age shall grow mellow with the thought of it
gone art thou then o mystical musician
pure thoughted singer of these sinful years
no more shall dreams and doubts and hopes and fears
pass and repass before thy stricken vision
no more from thine high sorrowing position
shall fall thy song irradiated tears
alas no more against our listening years
shall new lays ring from thy lone lute elysian
for unto thee at last has rest been given
whether in sleep eternal by the shore
of time's wide ocean or in song without
or break or flaw by the gold bar of that heaven
from which the blessed damozel leaned out
sighing for thee in the sad days of yore
ah where the hot wind with sweet odors laden
against the roses faintly beats his wings
uttering mild melodious murmurings
to the faint flowers and the fluttering gladen
whispering of some far sunset bowered aidenn
and in an orange tree an oriole sings
whereunder lies dreaming of unknown things
with orange blossoms wreathed a radiant maiden
there is the poet's land there would i lie
beneath the shadows of magnolia trees
and let my eyes grow languid and my mouth
glow with the kisses of the amorous breeze
and breathe with every breath the luxury
of the hot cheeked sweet heavy lidded south
after long lapse of years i tread again
the little frontier town's familiar ways
and on the mingled new and old i gaze
with joy that strives against a surging pain
i see old friends worn with life's struggle and strain
the little children of those far off days
bring their own broods for me to pet and praise
and ah how many a face i seek in vain
till as in dream i wander to and fro
with ghosts of dead companions at my side
why art thou spared to live they murmur low
why shouldst thou see the light while we abide
in darkness o beloved your taunts forbear
soon i with you the sunless house must share
adieu thou yale where youthful poets dwell
no more i linger by thy classic stream
inglorious ease and sportive songs farewell
thou startling clarion break the sleeper's dream
and sing ye bards the war inspiring theme
heard ye the din of battle clang of arms
saw ye the steel 'mid starry banners beam
quick throbs my breast at war's untried alarms
unknown pulsations stirr'd by glory's charms
while dear columbia calls no danger awes
though certain death to threaten'd chains be join'd
though fails this flesh devote to freedom's cause
can death subdue th' unconquerable mind
or adamantine chains ethereal substance bind
ere we can think of time  the moment's past
and straight another since that thought began
so swift each instant mingles with the last
the flying now exists  no more for man
with consciousness suspended ev'n by sleep
to what this phantom life then likest seems
say thou whose doubtful being lost in dreams
allows the wilder'd but to wake and weep
so thoughtless hurried to th' eternal deep
'tis like a moon light vision's airy shade
a bubble driving down the deep beneath
then ere the bubble burst the vision fade
dissolv'd in air this evanescent breath
let man not mortal learn true life begins at death
hark friends what sobs of sorrow moans of grief
on every gale through every  region spread
hark how the western world bewails our chief
great washington his country's father dead
our living light expiring with his breath
his bright example still illumes our way
through the dark valley of thy shadow death
to realms on high of life without decay
faint he relied on heav'nly help alone
while conscience cheer'd th' inevitable hour
when fades the glare of grandeur  pomp of pow'r
and all the pageantry that gems a throne
then from his hallow'd track who shall entice
columbia's sons to tread the paths of vice
you strange astonished looking angle faced
dreary mouthed gaping wretches of the sea
gulping salt water everlastingly
cold blooded though with red your blood be graced
and mute though dwellers in the roaring waste
and you all shapes beside that fishy be
some round some flat some long all devilry
legless unloving infamously chaste
o scaly slippery wet swift staring wights
what is't ye do what life lead eh dull goggles
how do ye vary your vile days and nights
how pass your sundays are ye still but joggles
in ceaseless wash still nought but gapes and bites
and drinks and stares diversified with boggles
amazing monster that for aught i know
with the first sight of thee didst make our race
for ever stare o flat and shocking face
grimly divided from the breast below
thou that on dry land horribly dost go
with a split body and most ridiculous pace
prong after prong disgracer of all grace
long useless finned haired upright unwet slow
o breather of unbreathable sword sharp air
how canst exist how bear thyself thou dry
and dreary sloth what particle canst share
of the only blessed life the watery
i sometimes see of ye an actual pair
go by linked fin by fin most odiously
green little vaulter in the sunny grass
catching your heart up at the feel of june
sole voice that's heard amidst the lazy noon
when even the bees lag at the summoning brass
and you warm little housekeeper who class
with those who think the candles come too soon
loving the fire and with your tricksome tune
nick the glad silent moments as they pass
oh sweet and tiny cousins that belong
one to the fields the other to the hearth
both have your sunshine both though small are strong
at your clear hearts and both were sent on earth
to sing in thoughtful ears this natural song
indoors and out summer and winter  mirth
it flows through old hushed egypt and its sands
like some grave mighty thought threading a dream
and times and things as in that vision seem
keeping along it their eternal stands
caves pillars pyramids the shepherd bands
that roamed through the young world the glory extreme
of high sesostris and that southern beam
the laughing queen that caught the world's great hands
then comes a mightier silence stern and strong
as of a world left empty of its throng
and the void weighs on us and then we wake
and hear the fruitful stream lapsing along
'twixt villages and think how we shall take
our own calm journey on for human sake
it is a lofty feeling yet a kind
thus to be topped with leaves  to have a sense
of honour shaded thought  an influence
as from great nature's fingers and be twined
with her old sacred verdurous ivy bind
as though she hallowed with that sylvan fence
a head that bows to her benevolence
midst pomp of fancied trumpets in the wind
it is what's within us crowned and kind and great
are all the conquering wishes it inspires
love of things lasting love of the tall woods
love of love's self and ardour for a state
of natural good befitting such desires
towns without gain and hunted solitudes
it lies before me there and my own breath
stirs its thin outer threads as though beside
the living head i stood in honoured pride
talking of lovely things that conquer death
perhaps he pressed it once or underneath
ran his fine fingers when he leant blank eyed
and saw in fancy adam and his bride
with their heaped locks or his own delphic wreath
there seems a love in hair though it be dead
it is the gentlest yet the strongest thread
of our frail plant  a blossom from the tree
surviving the proud trunk as if it said
patience and gentleness in power in me
behold affectionate eternity
o august brown and sleepy eyed and mellow
cinctured with vines and straying here and there
and permeating all the odorous air
with an aureole of translucent yellow
a thridded amber mist athwart the sun
most lovable art thou beyond compare
of all thy sisters like thee there is none
not blushing june nor the coquettish may
nor april that unknowing weeps and smiles
nor fervid july sunning all the isles
nor yet the cold white months with steely hair
that wrap in shrouds to show the year is done
stay with us sleepy mellow month o stay
here in some garden house by some lone bay
where art thou love whose strange sweet light of yore
made all the wide waste earth and seas and skies
as beautiful as erst was paradise
when our first parents learnt thy blissful lore
where art thou gone the winds and waters war
'gainst me defenceless with unceasing strife
my heart is famished and my path of life
unfruitful as a storm tormented shore
how dreadful is this world with thee away
how coarse and common all beneath the sky
if thou thy all atoning grace deny
o love for thee i anguish night and day
and search the heavens again and yet again
for thy returning wings but still in vain
as on a hidden voyage fast confined
a captive in his dungeon hears forlorn
free winds and waves and muffled voices borne
from fleeting shores unknown soon left behind
and hearing beats against his narrow walls
and strives to pierce them that the moving skies
may lay his path in light before his eyes
so hears my fettered soul at intervals
an outer world breathe near and tries the bond
and compass of her prison seeking still
to force some secret port from whose wide sill
she haply might look forth on light beyond
and see for weal or woe in truth's pure ray
the mystery of life's voyage wane away
it is not melody but harmony
that doth the halls of space with music fill
the universe was born of it and still
in every atom lives and moves thereby
yea each mere atom in that wondrous song
hath its own part and thence the stars arise
and set to harmony and brotherwise
bear one another's burdens and are strong
but ah the utt'rance of one note untrue
how faint soever then like pain or fear
a sudden tremor runs from sphere to sphere
and all creation doth the discord rue
e'en god's pure angels waver in their flight
though but a moment to'ards the throne of light
after so many days dark days and dire
in this wild land the home of savage men
to me forlorn 'neath alien stars again
life wears the splendour of promethean fire
i hear the harping of the pleiad choir
once more once more the music of the spheres
back to my hand olympian clio bears
the seven stringed foe of sorrow the sweet lyre
is this the valley where i groped astray
huge mountain shadows making dark my way
how strangely fair at each step fairer yet
and lo an awful and a lovely sight
one far off peak of calm unearthly light
god's great white throne it seems in heaven set
by fond heroic names in days of old
i spoke of thee and did not think to fear
thy presence and what time thy step drew near
i stood in loneliness serenely bold
ready to greet thee  waiting to behold
such was my faith great love within thine eyes
benign and light of light from paradise
that should grow brighter as my heart grew cold
now all is changed thou winter spare the bough
where love has built her dear and fragile nest
oh for the nestlings' sake and hers whose breast
protects them how i hate thee hate thee thou
hast laid thy hand upon my heart cruel death
and lest i shriek aloud i bar my breath
now from my sum of life full seventy years
have borne to my great master their report
wherein recorded to the slightest thought
the story of my vanished past appears
soon will he call me and not unawares
hence from his vineyard where i stand with naught
but poor unprofitable service wrought
counting the long array of sad arrears
and then a faint voice faintly understood
replies he that created thee did mark
yea search thee altogether and foreknew
ere the first fibre of thy body grew
ere yet thy spirit kindled from the dark
can he renounce thee and his fatherhood
is it deep sleep or is it rather death
rest anyhow it is and sweet is rest
no more the doubtful blessing of the breath
our god hath said that silence is the best
and thou art silent as the pale round moon
and near thee is our birth's great mystery
alas we knew not thou wouldst go so soon
we cannot tell where sky is lost in sea
but only find life's bark to come and go
by wondrous nature's hidden force impelled
then melts the wake in sea and none shall know
for certain which the course the vessel held
the lessening ship by us no more is seen
and sea and sky are just as they have been
haply some rajah first in ages gone
amid his languid ladies finger'd thee
while a black nightingale sun swart as he
sang his one wife love's passionate orison
haply thou mayst have pleased old prester john
among his pastures when full royally
he sat in tent  grave shepherds at his knee
while lamps of balsam winked and glimmered on
what dost thou here thy masters are all dead
my heart is full of ruth and yearning pain
at sight of thee o king that hast a crown
outlasting theirs and tells of greatness fled
through cloud hung nights of unabated rain
and murmur of the dark majestic town
upon the hopeless desert of her love
i landed lured by glamour of her face
and scarce on shore  a desolate strange place
i said  but surely some green cedar grove
awaits me proffering its cooling shade
and in its depths melodious fountains spring
so tear the canvas from the masts and bring
planks beams and spars until the pile be laid
then with my own mad hands i lit the fire
and watched with fevered eyes the dark mass burn
so blotting out the prospect of return
but daily cools the pulse of my desire
and bitter is the redness of her lips
oh god of love why did i burn my ships
suppose the dreaded messenger of death
should hasten steps that seem though sure so slow
and soon should whisper with his chilly breath
arise thine hour has sounded thou must go
for they that earliest taste life's holiest feast
must early fast lest grown too bold they dare
of them that follow after seize the share
then though my pulse's beat forever ceased
if where i slumbered thou shouldst chance to pass
though grave bound i thy presence should discern
heedless of coffin lid and tangled grass
upward to kiss thy feet my lips would yearn
and did one spark of love thy heart inflame
with the old rapture i should call thy name
and this is freedom cried the serf at last
i tread free soil the free air blows on me
and wild to learn the sweets of liberty
with eager hope his bosom bounded fast
but not for naught had the long years amassed
habit of slavery among the free
he still was servile and disheartened he
crept back to the old bondage of the past
long did i bear a hard and heavy chain
wreathegraved with amaranth and asphodel
but through the flower breaths stole the heavy pain
i cast it off and fled but 'twas in vain
for when once more i passed by where it fell
i took it up and bound it on again
one cannot draw the bars against the friends
and guests that crowd for entrance at his gate
he opes inviting nor the simple state
of his abode against their train defends
but there are chambers where the lover tends
his sacred fires where no feet penetrate
save of immortals where early and late
the breath of prayer and sacrifice ascends
in such a spot as this as in the shrine
of some white temple in a dusk made sweet
with incense far from outer noise and heat
and hollow haste of them that part and meet
surrounded by dim presences divine
my soul communes eternally with thine
the rough green wealth of wheaten fields that sway
in the low wind of midsummer all day
the morning valley's warm perfumed breeze
floating from southern sycamore shadowed rills
the singing forest on the dawn topped hills
the living depth of azure spacing seas
still brooding shadows upon mossy walls
aerial vapours crumbling down the heights
silence of woods amid green mellow lights
and sighs of distant drizzling waterfalls
the sweet faint breath of the short moonlit nights
from misty meadows where the quaint crake calls
rare pageants in the western day withdrawn
and fleets of rich light laden clouds at dawn
the rainbow o'er the sea of afternoon
whence comes the fresh sound of the distant wave
the mirrored lights that roof the lonely cave
where roll the waters from the rising moon
the airs that stir the grasses on the grave
and whisper spirit like to one beneath
that love in summer grieves no more for death
the first sweet secret touch of lips grown dear
in happy twilight woods when none are near
sweet fancies just awaked at morn when still
the level red cloud lies beyond the hill
such are the thoughts and objects that appear
to lap in sacred sadness or inspire
thy strings to beauty's moods oh summer lyre
regions of soft clear air of cold green leaves
heaths grasses solitary as a sea
vistas of gold and violet radiancy
isles where the surge and the lone wave bird grieves
white citied plains hill cinctured whence there flow
eurotean rivulets pellucidly
'mid laurels reeds blue lilies  in the glow
a cape with sheep and ruins like ripe sheaves
fallen columns smooth as aged ivory
some citadel remote or rocky pyre
the sunset turns to purple and to fire
gardens of thyme and groves of olives brown
along the slopes olympian vapours crown
like gods in commune formless divine and dire
remote from smoky cities aged and grey
i pass the long drawn summer sea side day
now reading in the garden arbour where
in light and silence comes the freckled morn
when dews are on the leaf and cool the air
the faint wave wash is heard the beach along
whence a warm wind waves languidly the corn
and poised in haze the lark shakes out her song
now hearing in deep grass the sweeping scythe
and in the sultry stillness voices blythe
'till day is done blue coolness comes once more
the reapers bind in twilight the last sheaf
and the fresh spring tide foams the sloaky reef
as floats the white moon up the lonely land
into the wood at close of rainy day
i walk dim cloud above green leaves around
upon the humid air only the sound
of drop on drop stirring the stillness grey
almost i hear the rose leaves fall away
too heavily weighed with damp to cling o'er blown
to their wet branches straggling o'er the copse
until the faint waved twilight airs entone
tide like along the blossom'd beech tree tops
and amid showers and flowers scattering alone
pass from the fresh dusk solitude among
meadows in clouded moonlight glimmeringly
seen like the low blue hills and hear the song
of the last bird and wash of the cool sea
awakened i behold through dewy leaves
wavering in the air the pale dawn's level glow
and hear the sparrow's twitter on the eaves
the engine's quick steam throb the first cock's crow
and soon a prayer bell toll remote and slow
and then a while with light reclosed eyes
i float upon my pillow as a cloud
unto a land whose snowy ruins rise
along a plain girt by blue mountains proud
and under solitary egerean skies
bright verdure and bright marbles in a dell
deserted where within a recluse well
through leafy lights i see a nymph's face beam
which fades not when in daylight dies my dream
upon an upland orchard's sunny side
i pass the quiet blue september day
there winds through tented fields they sometimes hide
past woods and meadows green the dusty way
down to the ship speckled level of the bay
and amber sands in crescent spreading wide
last night the winds were in the trees and here
in golden moss a few red apples lie
and from the copse a thrush flutes strong and clear
and faintly humming flits the emerald fly
all things autumnalised are rich and calm
steam plumed argosies surge up the main
and o'er the singing woodlands breathing balm
one superb white cloud passes dropping rain
the apples ripen under yellowing leaves
and in the farm yards by the little bay
the shadows come and go amid the sheaves
and on the long dry inland winding way
where in the thinning boughs each air bereaves
faint sunlights golden and the spider weaves
grey are the low laid sleepy hills and grey
the autumn solitude of the sea day
where from the deep 'mid channel less and less
you hear along the pale east afternoon
a sound uncertain as the silence swoon
the tide's sad voice ebbing toward loneliness
and past the sands and seas' blue level line
ceaseless the faint far murmur of the brine
an isle of trees full foliaged in a meadow
along whose quiet grassy shores below
the white sheep bathe in level lengths of shadow
and sweet airs amiable as summer blow
warmly and faint among the happy leaves
loving each other in a green repose
folded or waking in the slumbrous glow
where the wind passing indolently weaves
a net of lazy listless whisperings
most like the liquid lullaby of springs
pulsing demure and quaintly in some cool
dell of the woods unseen save of some ray
piercing the boughs having somewhat to say
to fairies couched on bubbles round the pool
when i had turned catullus into rhyme
and stars shone from the sea's blue southern zone
breathing in slumber tranquil as my own
above those pages of the antique time
laid in a casement near me where the vines
trembled their shade lo on a sudden rose
beautiful venus naked amid glows
of roseate cloud and all the lesbian lines
with her white finger touching as she smiled
stooped her and kissed them for a space beguiled
'till with a sigh she vanished then above
the sheaf of song in darkness i beheld
impassioned foreheads as of poet gods
bend their gold curls and o'er them muse enspelled
and wild and epic music from their abodes
heard blend in the high night with those of love
ye two fair trees that i so long have known
and loved as living over dust so dear
who silently have seen tear after tear
rise from my heart when to the engraved stone
i came to pray and with true love alone
live back old times amid a world so drear
with cares and changes of a many a year
and loss of most things i could love or own
now 'mid the calm of this blue april noon
while the fresh wind breathes warm from the clear west
put fancy once more with thy leaves in tune
green genial muse of the grey grave  for soon
by the dear dust it roofs i too shall rest
a roadside inn this summer saturday
the doors are open to the wide warm air
the parlour whose old window views the bay
garnished with cracked delph full of flowers fair
from the fields round and whence you see the glare
fall heavy on the hot slate roofs and o'er
the wall's tree shadows drooping in the sun
now rumbles slowly down the dusty street
the lazy drover's clattering cart and crows
fainter through afternoon the cock with hoes
tan faced harvest folk trudge in the heat
the neighbours at their shady doors swept clean
gossip and with cool eve fresh scents of wheat
grasses and leaves come from the meadows green
i walk of grey noons by the old canal
where rain drops patter on the autumn leaves
now watching from some ivied orchard wall
in slopes of stubble figures pile the sheaves
or under banks in shadow of their grass
blue water flies by starts jettingly pass
'mid large leaves level on the glassy cool
or noiseless dizzy midges winking round
the yellow sallows of the meadow pool
while into cloudy silence ebbs each sound
and sifts the moulting sunlight warm and mellow
o'er sandy beach remote or slumberous flood
or rooky red brick mansion by the wood
mossed gate or farmyard hay stacks tanned and yellow
now winter's dolorous days are o'er and through
march morning casements comes the sharp spring air
and noises from the distant city where
the steeples stand up keenly in the blue
no more the clouds by crispy frost defined
pile the pale north but float dispersed shapes
though still around the cool grey twilight capes
the sullen sea is dark with drifts of wind
like a forgotten fleck of snow still left
the cascade gleams in the far mountain cleft
brown rushes by the river's brimming bank
rustle and matted sedges sway and sigh
where grasses in sleek shallows waver dank
or drift in windy ripples greyly by
blow summer wind from yonder ocean blow
along the wild sea banks and grasses drear
and loamy shores where mosses brown and sere
and pale pinks in the sandy ridges grow
float round yon promontory in the brine
whose stretching arm in deepest azure lies
where quiet browse the heavy uddered kine
by rock and shining shallow grey and clear
and fill this listless hour the dreamy ear
with thy scarce toned and wordless harmonies
for here with nature will i rest and please
my heart with sweetest fancies all the noon
until the limpid crescent of the moon
lights the blue east above the evening trees
as yearning currents from the trackless snows
and silent polar seas unceasing sweep
to south to north and linger not where leap
red fires from glistening cones  nor where the rose
has triumph on the snow fed paramos
in upper air  nor yet where lifts the deep
its silver atollis on whose bosoms sleep
the purple sponges and as in repose
meeting at last they sink upon the breast
of that sweet tropic sea whose spicy balms
and central heat have drawn them to its arms
so soul seeks soul unsatisfied represt
till in love's tropic met they sink to rest
at peace forever in the zone of calms
along ancona's hills the shimmering heat
a tropic tide of air with ebb and flow
bathes all the fields of wheat until they glow
like flashing seas of green which toss and beat
around the vines the poppies lithe and fleet
seem running fiery torchment to and fro
to mark the shore
that they are there he walks with heavy feet
counting the bread and wine by autumn's gain
but i  i smile to think that days remain
perhaps to me in which though bread be sweet
no more and red wine warm my blood in vain
i shall be glad remembering how the fleet
lithe poppies ran like torchmen with the wheat
that he is dead the sons of kings are glad
and in their beds the tyrants sounder sleep
now he is dead his martyrdom will reap
late harvest of the palms it should have had
in life too late the tardy lands are sad
his unclaimed crown in secret they will keep
for ages while in chains they vainly weep
and vainly grope to find the roads he bade
them take o glorious soul there is no dearth
of worlds there must be many better worth
thy presence and thy leadership than this
no doubt on some great sun to day thy birth
is for a race the dawn of freedom's bliss
which but for thee it might for ages miss
o love sweet love who came with rosy sail
and foaming prow across the misty sea
o love brave love whose faith was full and free
that lands of sun and gold which could not fail
lay in the west that bloom no wintry gale
could blight and eyes whose love thine own should be
called thee with steadfast voice of prophecy
to shores unknown
thee nothing now thy faiths thy braveries
there is no sun no bloom a cold wind strips
the bitter foam from off the wave where dips
no more thy prow the eyes are hostile eyes
the gold is hidden vain thy tears and cries
o love poor love why didst thou burn thy ships
o patient shore thou canst not go to meet
thy love the restless sea how comfortest
thou all thy loneliness art thou at rest
when loosing his strong arms from round thy feet
he turns away know'st thou however sweet
that other shore may be that to thy breast
he must return and when in sterner test
he folds thee to a heart which does not beat
wraps thee in ice and gives no smile no kiss
to break long wintry days still dost thou miss
naught from thy trust still wait unfaltering
the higher warmer waves which leap in spring
o sweet wise shore to be so satisfied
o heart learn from the shore love has a tide
that they are brown no man will dare to say
he knows and yet i think that no man's look
ever those depths of light and shade forsook
until their gentle pain warned him away
of all sweet things i know but one which may
be likened to her eyes
of some green field the water of a brook
makes lingering whirling eddy in its way
round soft drowned leaves and in a flash of sun
they turn to gold until the ripples run
now brown now yellow changing as by some
swift spell
the saints but this i know my paradise
will mean the resurrection of her eyes
the thing i count and hold as fealty
the only fealty to give or take
doth never reckoning keep and coldly make
bond to itself with this or that to be
content as wage the wage unpaid to free
its hand from service and its love forsake
its faith cast off as one from dreams might wake
at morn and smiling watch the vision flee
such fealty is treason in disguise
who trusts it his death warrant sealed doth bear
love looks at it with angry wondering eyes
love knows the face true fealty doth wear
the pulse that beats unchanged by alien air
or hurts or crimes until the loved one dies
if loving you life's golden knowledge came
it rooted late and slowly in my soul
for youth dislikes the greys of wise control
and seeks as one enthralled the fatal flame
of lurid colours in precincts of shame
dear aged eyes that grieving could condole
foreseeing wisdom as the decades roll
and manhood growing worthy of its name
thus knowledge came slow dawning into truth
enshrined your face and made me strong and wise
o mother mine who mourned my wilful youth
now to your grave i come with bitter sighs
crying to you in penitence and ruth
all women have grown sacred in mine eyes
perhaps you did not know how bright last night
especially above your seaside door
was all the marvelous starlit sky and wore
white harmonies of very shining light
perhaps you did not want to seek the sight
of that remembered rapture any more
but then at least you must have heard the shore
roar with reverberant voices thro' the night
those stars were lit with longing of my own
and the ocean's moan was full of my own pain
yet doubtless it was well for both of us
you did not come but left me there alone
i hardly ought to see you much again
and stars we know are often dangerous
the things that one grows tired of  o be sure
they are only foolish artificial things
can a bird ever tire of having wings
and i so long as life and sense endure
or brief be they shall nevermore inure
my heart to the recurrence of the springs
of the gray dawns the gracious evenings
the infinite wheeling stars a wonder pure
must ever well within me to behold
venus decline or great orion whose belt
is studded with three nails of burning gold
ascend the winter heaven  who never felt
this wondering joy may yet be good or great
but envy him not he is not fortunate
thankful my country be to him who first
brought hither from australia oversea
sapling or seed of the undeciduous tree
whose grave and sombre foliage fears no burst
of heat from summer naked heavens nor thirst
though all the winter is rainless and the bee
starves finding not a blossom patiently
the great roots delve and feel though deep immersed
some layer of ancient moisture and the leaves
perish not hanging pointed in the sky
to see these lofty trunks gray barked and broad
wall with clear shade a long white southern road
i have been as one devoted who receives
an impulse or a promise from on high
it rained three autumn days then close to frost
under clear starlight the night shivering was
the dawn rose cold and colorless as glass
and when we wakened rains and clouds were lost
the ocean surged and shouted stormy tossed
i went down to companion him alas
what faint voice by the way the sudden grass
cried with thin lips as i the valley crossed
saying blade by blade although the warm sweet rain
awakened us this world is all too cold
we never dreamed it thus  your champion bold
is risen i said he in an hour or twain
will comfort you i passed above the dune
stood the wan splendorless daylight waning moon
when i behold the greatest and most wise
fall out of heaven wings not by pride struck numb
like satan's but to gain some humbler crumb
of pittance from penurious granaries
and when i see under each new disguise
the same cowardice of custom the same dumb
devil that drove our wordswroth to become
apologist of kings and priests and lies
and how a man may find in all he loathes
contentment after all and so endear it
by cowardly craft it grows his inmost own
then i renew my faith with firmer oaths
and bind with more tremendous vows a spirit
that often fallen never has lain prone
the soldier fought his battle silently
not his the strife that stays for set of sun
it seemed this warefare never might be done
through glaring day and blinding night fought he
there came no hand to help no eye to see
no herald's voice proclaimed the fight begun
no trumpet when the bitter field was won
sounded abroad the soldier's victory
as if the struggle had been light he went
gladly life's common road a little space
nor any knew how his heart's blood was spent
yet there were some who after testified
they saw a glory grow upon his face
and all men praised the soldier when he died
small fellowship of daily commonplace
we hold together dear constrained to go
diverging ways yet day by day i know
my life is sweeter for thy life's sweet grace
and if we meet but for a moment's space
thy touch thy word sets all the world aglow
faith soars serener haunting doubts shrink low
abashed before the sunshine of thy face
to part us every hush of evening brings
some hint of thee true hearted friend of mine
and as the farther planet thrills and swerves
when towards it through the darkness saturn swings
even so my spirit feels the spell of thine
along the eastern shore the low waves creep
making a ceaseless music on the sand
a song that gulls and curlews understand
the lullaby that sings the day to sleep
a thousand miles afar the grim pines keep
unending watch upon a shoreless land
yet through their tops swept by some wizard hand
the sound of surf comes singing up the steep
i mid the pines land wearied may but dream
of the far shore but though the distance seem
between us fixed impassable to me
cometh thy soul’s voice chanting love’s old theme
and mine doth answer as the pines the sea
my friend i need thee in good days or ill
i need the counsel of thy larger thought
and i would question all the year has brought
what spoil of books what victories of will
but most i long for the old wordless thrill
when on the shore like children picture taught
we watched each miracle the sweet day wrought
while the tide ebbed and every wind was still
we two with never need of spoken word
while the sea’s fingers twined among the dulse
and gulls dipped near our spirits seeming fused
in the great life that quickens wave and bird
our hearts in happy rhythm with the world pulse
because my life has lain so close to thine
because our hearts have kept a common beat
because thine eyes turned towards me frank and sweet
reveal sometimes thine untold thoughts to mine
think not that i by curious design
or over step of too impetuous feet
could desecrate thy soul’s supreme retreat
could disregard its quivering barrier line
on the world’s side of the most holy place
till as the new day glorifies the east
one come to lift the veil with reverent hand
and enter with thy soul’s soul face to face
he whom thy god shall call to be high priest
the morning brought a stranger to my door
i know not whence such feet as his may stray
from what still heights along what star set way
a child he seemed yet my eyes fell before
his eyes olympian  i did implore
him enter linger but one golden day
to bless my house he passed he might not stay
and though i call with tears he comes no more
at noon there stole a beggar to my gate
of subtle tongue the porter he beguiled
his creeping evil steps my house defiled
i flung him scornful alms i bade him straight
to leave me swift he clutched my fee and smiled
yet went not forth nor goes despite my hate
the christmas bells ring discord overhead
the angel song fell silent long ago
nor seer nor silly shepherd comes star led
to kneel to night beside a baby’s bed
peace is not yet and wrong and want and woe
cry in the streets and love is slow
and sin is sleek and swift and housed and fed
our prayers are as complaints our songs as cries
fain would we hear the angel voice once more
and see the star still lead along the skies
fain would like sage and simple folk of yore
watch where the christ child smiles in mary’s eyes
the southwind brought a voice was it of bird
or faint blown reed or string that quivered long
a haunting voice that woke into a song
sweet as a child’s low laugh or lover’s word
we listened idly till it grew and stirred
with throbbing chords of joy of love of wrong
a mighty music resonant and strong
our hearts beat higher for that voice far heard
it swept across the warm smile of the sun
a sudden shiver passed on field and wave
the grasses grieved along the river’s brim
we knew the voice was silent the song done
we knew the shadow smote across a grave
soul of the far but unforgotten past
queen of the sword and lady of the lyre
spirit of thoughts too high of deeds too vast
to fear like clay the waste of flood and fire
or darkly perish on oblivion's pyre
whence like the birds from memnon's pile they spring
born from the dust but not with years to tire
or furl in death the everlasting wing
teach me oh teach me but for once to fling
my hand thy own triumphal harp along
to strike one strain whose echoes yet may ring
above the spot where rests a friend of song
do i but dream the laurel yet may wave
memorial verdure over its votary's grave
when to the winds the firm oak's stately form
sways while each branch is as an organ key
dashed to mad music by the frantic storm
and swells the full tremendous melody
i love amid the sounding woods to be
and with a stern and solemn rapture hear
the straining forest's thunder  it is to me
an hour of awful bliss and glorious fear
but wilder stranger still swells on the ear
that shrill sound heard amid the tempest's pause
as it were a phantom's whisper deep yet clear
while its dread breath anew the spent blast draws
sounds not that voice which makes the listener pale
like some lone forest spirit's desolate wail
i hate you with a necessary hate
first i sought patience passionate was she
my patience turned in very scorn of me
that i should dare forgive a sin so great
as this through which i sit disconsolate
mourning for that live soul i used to see
soul of a saint whose friend i used to be
till you came by a cold corrupting fate
why come you now  you whom i cannot cease
with pure and perfect hate to hate go ring
the death bell with a deep triumphant toll
say you my friend sits by me still ah peace
call you this thing my friend this nameless thing
this living body hiding its dead soul
why no sir if a barren rascal cries
that he is most in love with pleasing woe
'tis plain sir what to think of him we know
the dog lies and the dog too knows he lies
sir if he's happy he will dry his eyes
and stroll at vauxhall for an hour or so
if he's unhappy it were best he go
hang himself straight nor pester us with sighs
enough sir let us have no more of it
your friend is little better than a whig
but you and i sir who are men of wit
laugh at the follies of a canting prig
let those who will sir to such whims submit
no sir we'll to the mitre frank my wig
imageries of dream reveal a gracious age
black armour falling lace and altar lights at morn
the courtesy of saints their gentleness and scorn
lights on an earth more fair than shone from plato's page
the courtesy of knights fair calm and sacred rage
the courtesy of love sorrow for love's sake borne
vanished those high conceits desolate and forlorn
we hunger against hope for that lost heritage
gone now the carven work ruined the golden shrine
no more the glorious organs pour their voice divine
no more rich frankincense drifts through the holy place
now from the broken tower what solemn bell still tolls
mourning what piteous death answer o saddened souls
who mourn the death of beauty and the death of grace
the marks of death were on him and he bore
in every feature that sharp clear cold look
which is not of this world his weak frame shook
yet not with terror shook for oft before
he had sought death amid the battle's roar
nor shrank he now when in his chamber lone
death visible death for three long moons had shown
his dart upraised but struck not still he wore
his brow though sad undaunted for he knew
this was his last great fight whose promise high
was endless glory to the faithful few
whose courage can endure to victory
and so he conquered and a soldier true
and gallant as he lived did gordon die
spirit of evil with which earth is rife
revenge revenge thee all abjure and blame
yet when their hour is come invoke thy name
base men for thee in secret bare the knife
the brave partake the peril and the strife
the weak the sword more sure of justice claim
the strong when they have blasted power and fame
give to their foe in scorn the curse of life
the keenest bitterest vengeance
for these all
are only shapes thou takest to goad the mind
turning the heart's pure generous blood to gall
and thus revenge thou stalkst through all the kind
till mighty nations madden at thy call
and earth is waste and seas incarnadined
i've seen my day before its noon decline
and dark is still the future nor alas
can hope with all the magic of her glass
irradiate the deep gloom which fate malign
has gathered round yet will i not repine
for though the courage that can do and dare
be brightest glory unsubdued to bear
that calmer better virtue may be mine
for this is of the mind to slay be slain
asks but a moment's energies and fame
first wakens and then keeps alive the flame
but patience must itself itself sustain
and must itself reward nor hope to find
the praise or the compassion of mankind
whether thy locks in natural beauty stray
clustering like woodbind wild or haply bound
like ivy wreath thy polished brows around
whether within thine eyes' blue mirror play
mirth's arrowy beams or love's more softened ray
whether to the gay viol's pleasant sound
thou minglest in the dance's airy round
thy light feet twinkling like the darts of day
or whether over the graceful harp thy frame
more graceful yet with eyes up raised thou bendest
and with its tones thy own far sweeter blendest
still thou art loveliest varying yet the same
still over my soul thine absolute sway extendest
and from all other loves thy heart defendest
there is a virtue which to fortune's height
follows us not but in the vale below
where dwell the ills of life disease and woe
holds on its steady course serenely bright
so some lone star whose softly beaming light
we mark not in the blaze of solar day
comes forth with pure and ever constant ray
that makes even beautiful the gloom of night
thou art that star so lovely and so lone
that virtue of distress  fidelity
and thou when every joy and hope are flown
clingst to the relics of humanity
making with all its sorrows life still dear
and death with all its terrors void of fear
in this small book i seek the sonnet's aid
some pictures of the past in words to paint
and show how seekers after god essayed
to find him patriarch and martyred saint
and spotless sage free from all selfish taint
and christian knight and missionary mild
and how heaven answers to the heart's wild plaint
and wisdom cometh to the little child
but none of those whom i on earth have known
have sought god's will with a more strenuous quest
with eager prayer and thought of him alone
and anxious wish to do his least behest
than thou my sister earliest dearest friend
to whom these autumn leaves with love i send
the bard who would the storied past rehearse
what things the spirit wrought in word and deed
should strike a note unerring in his verse
a cypher give that he who runs may read
how answers then the sonnet to his need
its meter strained its tangled sleave of rhyme
the structural artifice true art must heed
where stringent form and soaring thought should chime
art hath its phases now it stands sublime
in milton's marvellous imaginings
dryden's sonorous line stales not with time
in woodnotes wild the ayrshire ploughman sings
so none need scorn the pipe as small for fame
by petrarch blown and browning's gentle dame
i leave the trumpet and full throated horn
of epic to the leaders of the choir
the martial strain the sigh of love forlorn
to him who smites the loud resounding lyre
and chants with lips touched by the sacred fire
imperial themes of patriot fervor born
the joy of combat and the noble ire
that withers wrong with fierce consuming fire
my task to show the patriarchs of the eld
and seekers after god by nature's light
and saints who witnessed truth in suffering
small pictures of the past by faith beheld
that grants dim eyes a sacred second sight
these in the sonnet's narrow bounds i sing
the search of man for god the mightiest theme
that ever can his loftiest thought engage
is his clear vision but an idle dream
the mind's mirage to lure the doubting sage
with phantom waters that can not assuage
his thirst devine or are the spires that gleam
above heaven's battlements from age to age
to eyes unsealed as real as they seem
to him who sees them not they are not clod
of crudest clay by spirit uninformed
his body breath and reason have their day
and into nothingness would pass away
but that by grace regenerate and warmed
to a new being he may grope toward god
the budding world was in its bloomstrewn prime
and from it nature rose a temple vast
its architects twin titans space and time
rested their handiwork complete when last
into the pageant a new being passed
the one appointed in the splendid shrine
high priest o'er all his soverein sway to cast
and fill the void with energy divine
for all the beams from stars moon sun that shine
could not from nature lift the dreary pall
till on man's brow was set the imperial sign
of the self conscious soul that saw it all
in the clear light of reason which to men
came through the window opened from heaven then
the mighty temple of the human soul
lit through one only casement by a ray
of natural reason saw long ages roll
while mankind mouldered to a slow decay
because they yielded not to reason's sway
but let false fiends crawl to the niches high
and foul forms squat in places where men pray
so that 't were best this race corrupt should die
but no man hath a loftier destiny
knowledge gives light but from the sloughs of sense
in vain the struggling soul essays to fly
unless obedience leads the spirit hence
another window's radiance through the gloom
to noah showed man's path from death and doom
from the broad plains where wandering herdsmen dwelt
a prince of ur  men call him now a sheikh
of the colossal type severe antique
led off his bands the lord had kindly dealt
with him and his his grateful spirit felt
the trust a son unto his father feels
as in his boyhood at that knee he kneels
while all his fervent love and passions melt
into a faith unquenchable supreme
in god he trusts from heaven's high battlement
a blaze of glory fills his horsehair tent
and rolling splendors o'er his spirit stream
his vision pierces nature's lofty dome
and treads the fields where guardian angels roam
from egypt's teeming fields the hebrews fled
passed the deep waters tracked the desert sand
following his steps where'er the seer led
and to the mountain came an altar grand
reared in the waste by an almighty hand
that here earth's self should smoke and flames arise
while royal moses as high priest should stand
the tables twain to take and sacrifice
then came the law amid a nation's cries
of fear and mad revolt from god's command
and lurid light that issuing from the skies
made all the earth at last a holy land
commandments forged to fetter men from wrong
but wrought by righteousness to weapons strong
spirit divine that o'er creation broods
filling with life the outer bounds of space
and thrilling further yet the amplitudes
beyond the finite ken thou hast by grace
from thy pure essence lent a spark a trace
of deity in those benignant moods
wherein the infinite reveals his face
to holy men but still their grasp eludes
and thus to david's heaven strung harp there came
music that matched the worship of his song
remorse and penitence and words of flame
and prophets spake with inspiration strong
before their eyes ages to come unroll
and fire touched lips recite the seraphs' scroll
going down through the valley of hades
the immemorial dim dusk of the eld
of my daemon i ask whose grand shade is
that presence majestic that form unexcelled
and then by emotions prepotent impelled
i say as the hem of his raiment i touch
dear master if thou hast in silence withheld
some part of thy wisdom of which thou hast much
teach me i pray thee in aid of mankind
pythagoras answered one thing is sure
man is deaf to the rhythm of nature and blind
to its order physician this thought is his cure
that kosmos is justly and wisely designed
and its harmony sounds in the ears of the pure
in early hellas clear as crystal wave
in sky in atmosphere in minds of men
whether in frolic sport or discourse grave
its thought ran riot or beyond the ken
of worshippers of idols of the den
lifted its haughty head to probe the vault
and from olympus force reply again
the strong winged soul found in its flight no halt
but to the empyreal sphere soared in assault
so socrates through myth and mystery saw
and plato strove the idea to exalt
that veiled the maker in unchanging law
seekers for truth in which for god they sought
and won the crown for which their souls had wrought
when socrates he of the shabby robe
had earned from athens the unjust decree
that sentenced him to death because his probe
had touched its self love pity said go free
thy prison gates to night unbarred shall be
walk forth and in some happier clime thy fame
will blossom yet to immortality
nor can detraction visit thee with blame
nay  friends have i not told you that there came
unto mine inmost soul a potent voice
that bade me put all false conceit to shame
and place the common welfare first no choice
is left for me the hemlock cup to take
is better far than athens' laws to break
a threadbare cloak alas a tattered sleeve
a smile ironical a biting tongue
the honied sarcasm of a bee that stung
the arguments that puzzle and deceive
the snares his crafty questions interweave
and yet o socrates how wise men hung
upon thy words those precious jewels flung
unto a swinish multitude it grieves
our very souls that plato's garnered sheaves
and worthy xenophon's small talk is all
that from the buried past we can recall
small remnant of thy legacy it leaves
one saying stays that thou wouldst gladly die
to share with just men immortality
these ceremonial forms and ancient rites
these solemn auguries by seers made
the sign that bodes the portent that affrights
the ghost of which the soldier is afraid
the pomp of superstition's masquerade
are passing dreams to scipio who delights
to climb with plato the aerial grade
of thought where calm philosophy invites
conqueror of carthage there are loftier heights
to which thy soul shall rise the captive maid
free from all fear the victory that excites
nor wrath nor greed these laurels shall not fade
thy clement soul in search of truth shall see
three golden steps to know to do to be
the foremost man of all the world is't true
his was a mind that grasped the whole of life
that gazed with equal brow on calm and strife
gleaned what the past bequeathed yet seized the new
and saw the ages march in grand review
the stern republic of an earlier day
rent into fragments mouldering to decay
still felt the thirst to combat and subdue
the instinct fierce the old paths to pursue
which led to conquest and imperial sway
this caeligsar saw and though his pathway lay
across the muniments of time he drew
into his sovereign hand all that was old
and bade a new world from the germs unfold
when martial rome had stretched her conquering sword
wide o'er the lands philosophy held sway
where once ancestral gods had been adored
then rival sects made battle in word play
stoic and epicurean had his say
and in the clash of tongues each felt assured
that he alone stood in the light of day
great tully looked on smiling and endured
the babble till his patience was outworn
then with full measure of his talents ten
and mental sinews trained in every school
and learning copious as rich plenty's horn
he grasped the problem old 'twixt gods and men
to find in nature that one god must rule
favorite of fortune seneca the wise
offspring of intelect and virtuous thought
possessing all things that men seek or prize
desiring most the things that good men ought
and loving well the truths himself had taught
yet by the cruel irony of fate
condemned to wear as chains what most men sought
rank ease power wealth the favor of the great
he kept his steadfast eyes on virtue's gate
but dared not enter it beyond retreat
for crouching near envy and lynx eyed hate
and murder foul watched his advancing feet
his nerveless hand to cope with evil tried
but lacking strength greatly to live  he died
slave of the slave of taht still baser slave
who having all things worshipped self alone
nero in whose foul breast as in a grave
festered all infamies born of a throne
one epictetus a poor cripple shone
upon a darkened world as shines a star
through a dim clouded dawn and to the moan
of human pain that welled up near and far
pointed in silence to his scourge and scar
or spoke to fainting hearts who would be strong
balm for the sores of peace the wounds of war
must learn to suffer and to do no wrong
his words his life to men a lesson gave
that made aurelius pattern on the slave
victorious rome had crystallized the world
into an empire and her genius stood
in one man lodged until his brain was whirled
with madness and untrammeled masterhood
and evil sat enthroned nor any could
stem or withstand corruption's poisonous tide
so that belief that aught of true or good
on earth remained in human hearts had died
but that imperial power thus deified
came to a youth self centred truly great
who made a chaste philosophy the bride
of his exalted reason and the state
his only care but yet in twilight groped
while slaves attained what marcus only hoped
a voice a voice  and is it but a voice
that from the wilderness sends up a cry
god's kingdom is at hand your only choice
o wretched is to turn from sin or die
bring forth good fruits the poor man's needs supply
be just be merciful behold the lord
whose rule shall spread unto eternity
a prophet i nay but a voice the word
that was and is comes like a seraph's sword
to bend brute force to the free spirit's sway
where'er his tidings glad by men are heard
but john's faint echoes shall soon die away
not so o greater than a prophet thou
from herod's dungeon rose and livest now
what went ye to the wilderness to see
was it a reed shaken by the desert wind
but wherefore went ye hoping what to find
a man clothed in soft raiment nay but he
who dares to beard the haughty pharisee
in camel's hair and leathern girdle clad
brings contrite hearts the gospel that makes glad
and warns the wicked heaven's wrath to flee
for one will come whose fan is in his hand
to gather in his wheat and purge the floor
john is his herald none has gone before
of woman born whose name shall greater stand
but yet unto the very least in heaven
a higher place than unto john is given
bare kneed he waded in the reedy lake
or pushed his scallop further from the shore
or hoisted sail where rougher waters break
with stalwart arms that plied the bladed oar
and shoulders galled with teh huge loads they bore
but still beneath their pent house gleamed dark eyes
with lambent fire and his stern visage wore
the signs of thought that spreads its wings and flies
but why to him should come the glad surprise
why should he be messiah's chosen friend
this fisherman of bleak gennesaret
bidden henceforth for men to cast his net
the lord whose kingdom comes and knows no end
discerns his own through nature's thin disguise
the twelve and the one they were thirteen in all
were wearily walking a summer's day
the road to the roman city whose wall
loomed by the coast they were seeking the way
to eternal life and they halted to pray
then jesus asked of the twelve by what name
the people spake of him whom did they say
the son of man was they answered his fame
was that of a prophet elijah or john
but whom say ye that i am said the lord
simon answered the christ thou art the son
of the living god then jesus that word
is the rock i build on thou peter art blest
that my father hath shown thee what thou hast confessed
the king of glory took the cup of shame
and pressed it to his lips by one betrayed
all the apostles who had in his name
wrought miracles fled from him sore afraid
but peter followed though afar and stayed
outside the throng and yet within the court
dazed with tumultuous terrors when a maid
spied him  and cried thou too make thy report
thou nazarene he cursed yea he denied
with oaths that he was of them or even knew
the man of sorrows shortly to be tried
thus thrice e'er dawn and when the cock twice crew
he was aware and wept o human heart
how strong how weak how wonderful thou art
where late ye fled a flock of fugitives
scattered like sheep before a ravening beast
because your christ was dead now that he lives
and ye have seen him all your fears have ceased
nor herod pilate sanhedrim or priest
can awe you any more for pentecost
hath signed your brows with flame and so increased
your zeal for christ that each man is a host
eager to meet what other men fear most
and what the rest desire esteeming least
so peter who denied again can boast
that death is welcome as a marriage feast
transformed by grace no more his soul shall quail
nor 'gainst the rock the gates of hell prevail
the chief priest asked what man shall have command
and journey to damascus to hale thence
the wretched nazarenes who fret the land
with lies about their false christ an offense
deserving death we need intelligence
courage and fiery zeal that will withstand
pity prayer argument a man intense
fierce for the law and with an iron hand
a scribe replied the man to lead your band
is saul of tarsus by all men confessed
vehement in faith without fear and grand
in hate of error he will cure the pest
saul breathing slaughter was for havock sent
the scourge of god came back a penitent
what haughty horseman rides the dusty road
that to damascus leads it is the jew
who at gamaliel's feet so long abode
and all the learning of the ancients knew
a pharisee of pharisees he grew
wise in the law of moses israel's code
and inspiration from the prophets drew
bending his shoulders to the talmud's load
so that to him all streams of influence flowed
to fill his soul with wrath against the crew
of recreant hebrews who sedition sowed
and stir his zeal their schism to subdue
to shield the covenant with his stubborn will
was saul's large purpose god's was larger still
proud saul on bigotry's harsh mission bound
with rancor filled across the sultry plain
toward green damascus shook his bridle rein
when lo a sudden glory shone around
and stricken with blindness prostrate to the ground
he fell with all his band o paul in vain
didst thou consent to witness stephen slain
almighty power can human plans confound
thy learning zeal and heart brave clean and sound
the lord had need of so that thou didst gain
through blindness sight the right to suffer pain
and at the last with martyrdom be crowned
the voice that spake to thee gave thee a voice
that bade the gentile world in christ rejoice
o for the vision of glory that broke
on the soul of the saint apostle of love
who hung on the master's lips when he spoke
and beheld the spirit in shape like a dove
descend on his lord and heard from above
the voice that called him his son and awoke
to the fact  the great fact  the centuries prove
that matter serves spirit as symbol and cloak
his eyes were unsealed through love for the friend
who had chastened his zeal and pointed the way
to the realm of the lamb and bliss without end
the splendors of zion and perpetual day
love was the key to those portals of love
that opened to earth the mansions above
vision on vision of glory supernal
broke like wild billows on soul and on sight
of the saint who through time and aeons eternal
and realms beyond space in spirit took flight
mountains delectable streams of delight
oceans of crystal and islands elysian
cherubim seraphim angels of might
bands of the blest bent on heavenly mission
and jesus himself in glory resplendent
the first and the last on jasper enthroned
star sceptered supreme with power transcendent
in garments of pity with righteousness zoned
to john the divine were on patmos revealed
when the angel of god his eyes had unsealed
the rome of diocletian steeped in blood
of christian martyrs long had passed away
and the new faith like a great alpine flood
above the empire's submerged levels lay
and even the caeligsars owned christ's gentle sway
yet in the circus low browed thousands swarmed
to watch the gladiators' brutal fray
and cheered the onset and for victims stormed
the games were set the swordsmen stood arrayed
when from the benches to the arena sprang
the monk telemachus beating down each blade
then the mob stoned him while their fierce cries rang
there the monk died the sand stained with his gore
rome wept and saw those bloody sports no more
the world is cruel in the slough of sin
and bad brute force tramples on adam's seed
in the hot race of life the vilest win
and power wrings tribute from the poor man's need
then what is left is shared by craft and greed
heaven hath no ear to hear amid the din
though lust corrupts and human hearts must bleed
when will the reign of righteousness begin
eager am i my trembling soul to save
o god thou knowest that i would be pure
but man is cruel and i am not strong
to cope with savagery and combat wrong
still i can pray shun sin and much endure
far from the world hid in some desert cave
the world is full of sin  a cruel world
king satan hath unbarred the gates of hell
and his foul cohorts of bad spirits hurled
to spread confusion and the discord swell
these rave and ravin and strike the final knell
of man on earth millennium now draws near
and imminent war with the foul fiends who fell
so timid souls creep palsied with base fear
but why stand i braced with this stalwart brawn
and with a heart robust as solid oak
but to make battle with the infernal spawn
and stand between them and god's common folk
therefore to god and man whate'er my fate
my sword my strength my life i dedicate
the great world seethes men fight for gold or power
and bloodstains redden castle court and cot
sin stalks abroad or shames the lady's bower
in vain we look to find the happy spot
where righteousness prevails and sin is not
the cloister only is a rock built tower
against the woe which is the common lot
the wretchedness that is our earthly dower
here in its sheltered walls i quiet find
as peacefully i pace the shaded walk
and list our stately abbot's wise sweet talk
or join in psalmody with joyous mind
or that christ's gospel some poor souls may reach
what things i know i humbly gladly teach
have pity dear christ on the sons of men
who grovel and starve in alleys and docks
the wolf hath his lair the bear hath his den
and conies hide in the holes of the rocks
but the shelter of home is denied thy flocks
who huddle and slink in the filth and mire
of the sewers called cities wehre misery mocks
whose sons pass to moloch through torture and fire
but i what can i do jesu i can cry
dear brother come forth from the cesspool of sin
the help of my hand the throb of my heart
are thine if thou wilt rise up do thy part
thou canst not thou shalt one soul i will win
for the lord who is deaf to no penitent's sigh
what seer can tell where mighty thoughts are born
or whence they come to men the humble cot
by which the proud pass with a glance of scorn
in after days becomes a hallowed spot
where pilgrim feet resort the fates allot
unto porphyrogene oblivion's pall
imperial grandeur is right soon forgot
the grave's black bondage makes of wealth its thrall
columbus nurtured near the weaver's beam
where a sad sire the frequent shuttle threw
saw floods of light upon his spirit stream
and from heaven's fountains living waters drew
through work and zeal the vision large unfurled
that gave mankind and him a second world
thou art not yet a saint or canonized
in calendar of church or men's esteem
grand christopher the things thy soul most prized
the two worlds that made up thy life long dream
are commonplace and trite as men now deem
the young world that thy caravels explored
beyond the ocean's verge and earth's extreme
but most the sphere unseen wherein thy spirit soared
but who among the sons of mortal men
showed stouter heart in want or storm or fray
or fortitude the stings of fate to bear
at each rebuff thine essay made again
through mirk and misdoubt found at last a way
and heaven made answer to thy toil and prayer
when pampeluna's walls in dust were laid
some stout defenders still on fight intent
back to the citadel their footsteps bent
and there loyola tranquil undismayed
still held the breach with his ensanguined blade
until he sank with grievous wounds forspent
then on the couch of pain with anguish rent
to king and country his full debt was paid
there to a higher life he felt the call
and found the pattern of a perfect man
in jesus and conceived the mighty plan
of service in his name that holds in thrall
the masterful and wise and bends the will
of thousands in its forceful bondage still
bluff latimer brave honest and robust
who cared not what the court or courtiers thought
but had a charge to keep a sacred trust
a mission and a work that must be wrought
a battle with the arch fiend to be fought
and met unblenched great harry's awful frown
those bended brows with deadly purpose fraught
looking beyond to a thorn twisted crown
when at the stake the cruel flame's mad flight
wreathed to an aureole round his reverend head
to ridley said brother this candle's light
will over all the realm of england spread
thus persecution's baleful pyre became
truth's dayspring and a pentecostal flame
centuries of form and dogma had o'erpast
since christ had shown men how to live and die
and saints had come and gone and now at last
religion cloaked conventionality
the world was sunk in sense  a living lie
and england's easy ethics futile thought
cast in a mould of smug gentility
deemed poor humanity a thing of naught
but underneath that rotten thin veneer
surged fires volcanic born of human hate
that wrecked the order and the idea old
so all seemed lost but that ithuriel's spear
in wesley's hand unmasked the potentate
of hell and warmed to life men's hearts grown cold
o mighty preacher heretic and saint
who liftest high thy soul above the fog
of creed and ritual and the cimmerian bog
of dogma in whose quicksands strong men faint
how hast thy soaring spirit 'scaped the taint
of a material creed and risen to heights sublime
o'erleaping the strong fence of space and time
in bold attempts the ways of god to paint
such strength is given by him who knows all hearts
who sets for each the limits of his scope
who hath endowed thee with a prescience rare
to see things as they are in whole not parts
and filled thee with the love and faith and hope
of those who feel the master's special care
i looked toward zion with uplifted eyes
and saw upon its height that wondrous shrine
built for his god by solomon the wise
fit dwelling for jehovah lord divine
on stone and cedar golden bucklers shine
but most of all its stately portal caught
my rapt attention and reverent thought
with two grand pillars of inspired design
i looked again but this time with the eye
of faith that gazed upon a fabric fair
built by the spirit pillars twain were there
established  strong  wisdom and charity
upon their front this legend these endure
stanley and kingsley make the saying sure
on the further verge of this vast round world
in the waste of waters realm of the wave
lie dreamy isles on its bosom impearled
where the billows surge and the strong blasts rave
for a myriad years they have been the grave
of races forgotten unshriven unblest
but a hero said they have souls to save
and went with the cross on his dreary quest
he planted the blistered blood stained rood
and watered with tears it grew and spread
like the fronds of a palm and the storms withstood
but the tempest fell on the good man's head
as he prayed and toiled without surcease
till the lord through martyrdom gave release
for fourscore years he trod this mortal earth
unsoiled by touch with all its devious ways
so good men loved his genius and his worth
and freely gave him honest meed of praise
and thus he rounded out his length of days
in usefulness and honor so he became
the guide of souls lost in life's tangled maze
but still his work was in his master's name
willing to bear for him the cross of shame
with potent teaching his winged words went wide
searching the hearts of men as with a flame
and as he told how jesus lived and died
on seraph's pinions his rapt spirit soared
and o'er the world its holy influence poured
two mighty angels of the lord of hosts
swept to our earth from realms beyond the sky
fulfilling thus the service of their posts
homeward a saintly soul to bear on high
their names were life and immortality
the angel life saith here they call me death
and when life comes to souls men say they die
and thou too art with them a passing breath
this is not right the other angel saith
the soul that soars to heaven should still abide
on earth till time shall end and life called death
shall over sin and pain victorious ride
its influence pouring in a love divine
on human hearts that hold it as a shrine
in royal purple and fine linen clad
dives sat in his lordly banquet hall
and wallowed in his wealth and thought that all
was gathered there that can the heart make glad
and from his table to a beggar sad
there fell some crumbs as he lay at the gate
sick sore and bruised in body and estate
then the world passed and each his portion had
and dives thirsting looked from nether hell
to where in abram's bosom lazarus lay
in peace and comforted and fell to pray
and make his plaint and all his woes to tell
then abram answered son thou hadst thy part
and now this poor one must lie next my heart
tall marble columns placques of malachite
things wrought in ivory fabrics for each whim
broad acres steeds that mock the arrow's flight
and white sailed ships deep laden to the brim
or built for pride o'er summer seas to skim
riches in all its forms to use or waste
are dives' and their glitter shed on him
they throng and urge him pleasure's cup to taste
unto his well groomed body cleanly shaped
he says o body thou art sound and whole
then whispers to a something darkly draped
but thou o secret wretched leprous soul
canst thou win back by all this store of wealth
one hour one moment of the breath of health
throughout the long procession of the ages
the seekers after god in pain have striven
and saints have suffered and to wistful sages
a glimpse of truth eternal has been given
like those rare sentries in the vault of heaven
that make it luminous with shining rays
the pleiades the sacred sisters seven
sirius and splendid arcturus these blaze
meanwhile a multitude in tangled maze
of starry systems link their astral shields
and crowd in nebulous ranks the milky ways
or rove unnoted interstellar fields
so men revere the peerage of the past
nor heed the light by lowly sainthood cast
we are encompassed in our daily round
by a vast multitude a mighty throng
a cloud of witnesses whose souls the song
of praise to god utter without a sound
in whose pure hearts trust hope and love abound
whose instant prayers ascend on noiseless wings
whose proof of faith in secret alms is found
the sacrifice claimed by the king of kings
who are these saints that wear no earthly crown
of glittering gems or yet more royal thorns
no outward sign of holiness adorns
their plain humanity in field or town
they move unseen save by the sleepless eye
that reads all hearts  the conscious destiny
meek mary thou hast chosen the better part
then why dost thou cumber thyself with cares
the great world thou livest in onward fares
in spite of the burdens laid on thy heart
that world will wag on though thy conscience start
for fear that thy work is not fully done
and yet thou art busy from rise of the sun
in deeds for others in temple and mart
thy hands are apt and thy will is strong
thy mind is alert and thou dost not shun
toil for thy fellows the good work begun
by thee to the end must be carried along
'tis thus that the web of the world is spun
by a mary and martha joined in one
along sequestered paths her spirit trod
and shunned the highway and the world's hot glare
you knew her for a chosen child of god
who breathed his graces as her native air
but ne'er forgot her father's loving care
erect in soul before her fellow man
her high born dignity bent down to share
each common woe that mars life's rounded plan
the oil of gladness in her hand she bore
and poured it as a balm for every wound
and lightened every fellow sufferer's lot
so grateful eyes saw in her garb no spot
but angel's vestments and beheld her crowned
but i  shall i see her loved face no more
i never wholly feel that summer is high
however green the trees or loud the birds
however movelessly eye winking herds
stand in field ponds or under large trees lie
till i do climb all cultured pastures by
that hedged by hedgerows studiously fretted trim
smile like a lady's face with lace laced prim
and on some moor or hill that seeks the sky
lonely and nakedly  utterly lie down
and feel the sunshine throbbing on body and limb
my drowsy brain in pleasant drunkenness swim
each rising thought sink back and dreamily drown
smiles creep o'er my face and smother my lips and cloy
each muscle sink to itself and separately enjoy
after the summer's fierce and thirsty glare
after the falling leaves and falling rain
when harsh winds beat the fields of ripened grain
and autumn's pennons from the branches flare
there comes a stilly season soft and fair
when clouds are lifted winds are hushed again
a phantom summer hovering without pain
in the veiled radiance of the quiet air
when folding down the line of level seas
a silver mist at noonday faintly broods
and like becalmeacuted ships the yellow trees
stand islanded in windless solitudes
each leaf unstirred and parching for the breeze
that hides and lingers northward in the woods
the circling hills of woods and clouds snow white
held in the golden hour of eventide
the lake by which i walked and seemed to hide
from view a world yet lovelier whose light
streamed up behind their heights and made them glow
as wrapped in purest flame and flung on high
bright flakes of glory 'gainst the pale blue sky
which bridged with paths of light the lake below
i felt sweet music that i could not hear
i saw a poem that i could not read
what place is this i cried lo at my need
two lovers passed  'twas paradise for clear
i saw it shining in his happy eyes
i heard it murmur'd in her low replies
poor poet ape that would be thought our chief
whose works are e'en the frippery of wit
from brokage is become so bold a thief
as we the robbed leave rage and pity it
at first he made low shifts would pick and glean
buy the reversion of old plays now grown
to a little wealth and credit in the scene
he takes up all makes each man's wit his own
and told of this he slights it  tut such crimes
the sluggish gaping auditor devours
he marks not whose 'twas first and after times
may judge it to be his as well as ours
fool as if half eyes will not know a fleece
from locks of wool or shreds from the whole piece
descending night enfolds the lonely veld
soon from the purple background of the sky
the spangled jewels of orion's belt
will shine amidst the starry canopy
deep and yet deeper grows the changing scene
the dim recesses of the dreamy plain
wrapt in their endless solitude serene
faint and yet fainter from the vision wane
a tense mysterious silence holds its sway
and far beyond the distant mountains clear
the passing glimpses of declining day
now vanish  and the afric night is here
so nature's lamps are lighted at the call
of her the handmaid of the god of all
paint me a picture where the golden hair
like sunlight falls around the chiselled face
of grecian imaging  limn me the grace
of spiritual beauty jewel rare
in features human yet divinely fair
let through the dark blue splendour of the eye
ethereal hope shine star like with chaste love
and on the brow a wisdom from above
and on the lip a happy secret lie
fraught with the spirit's sweetest sorcery
suffuse her face with music and the charm
the animated glow of lofty thought
let cynthia's mien with stately mildness fraught
and queenly grace adorn th' ideal form
and let her stand on some green isle of bliss
where seraphs stoop to woo her witching kiss
words are the coin of fools so spake the sage
but tables of the wise whereon they count
the golden gems of thought and keep the page
of reckoning so brother be the amount
of all thou sayest or shalt say to men
the product of a pure true seeking mind
and symbols of deep thought tried and refined
won from the mine of rich experience then
shall all thy words be gold and will outlast
the eating rust of time and men will say
when thou art dead  looking upon thy past
this man hath earned him a fair name for aye
and in the inmost shrine of memory
they'll rear a precious monument for thee
if by dull rhymes our english must be chained
and like andromeda the sonnet sweet
fettered in spite of paineacuted loveliness
let us find out if we must be constrained
sandals more interwoven and complete
to fit the naked foot of poesy
let us inspect the lyre and weigh the stress
of every chord and see what may be gained
by ear industrious and attention meet
misers of sound and syllable no less
than midas of his coinage let us be
jealous of dead leaves in the bay wreath crown
so if we may not let the muse be free
she will be bound with garlands of her own
much have i travell'd in the realms of gold
and many goodly states and kingdoms seen
round many western islands have i been
which bards in fealty to apollo hold
oft of one wide expanse had i been told
that deep brow'd homer ruled as his demesne
yet did i never breathe its pure serene
till i heard chapman speak out loud and bold
then felt i like some watcher of the skies
when a new planet swims into his ken
or like stout cortez when with eagle eyes
he star'd at the pacific  and all his men
look'd at each other with a wild surmise
silent upon a peak in darien
the poetry of earth is never dead
when all the birds are faint with the hot sun
and hide in cooling trees a voice will run
from hedge to hedge about the new mown mead
that is the grasshopper's  he takes the lead
in summer luxury  he has never done
with his delights for when tired out with fun
he rests at ease beneath some pleasant weed
the poetry of earth is ceasing never
on a lone winter evening when the frost
has wrought a silence from the stove there shrills
the cricket's song in warmth increasing ever
and seems to one in drowsiness half lost
the grasshopper's among some grassy hills
o golden tongued romance with serene lute
fair plumed syren queen of far away
leave melodizing on this wintry day
shut up thine olden pages and be mute
adieu for once again the fierce dispute
betwixt damnation and impassion'd clay
must i burn through once more humbly assay
the bitter sweet of this shakespearian fruit
chief poet and ye clouds of albion
begetters of our deep eternal theme
when through the old oak forest i am gone
let me not wander in a barren dream
but when i am consumed in the fire
give me new phoenix wings to fly at my desire
my spirit is too weak  mortality
weighs heavily on me like unwilling sleep
and each imagin'd pinnacle and steep
of godlike hardship tells me i must die
like a sick eagle looking at the sky
yet 'tis a gentle luxury to weep
that i have not the cloudy winds to keep
fresh for the opening of the morning's eye
such dim conceived glories of the brain
bring round the heart an undescribable feud
so do these wonders a most dizzy pain
that mingles grecian grandeur with the rude
wasting of old time  with a billowy main
a sun  a shadow of a magnitude
why did i laugh tonight no voice will tell
no god no demon of severe response
deigns to reply from heaven or from hell
then to my human heart i turn at once
heart thou and i are here sad and alone
i say why did i laugh  mortal pain
o darkness darkness ever must i moan
to question heaven and hell and heart in vain
why did i laugh i know this being's lease
my fancy to its utmost blisses spreads
yet would i on this very midnight cease
and the world's gaudy ensigns see in shreds
verse fame and beauty are intense indeed
but death intenser  death is life's high meed
when i have fears that i may cease to be
before my pen has glean'd my teeming brain
before high piled books in charactery
hold like rich garners the full ripen'd grain
when i behold upon the night's starr'd face
huge cloudy symbols of a high romance
and think that i may never live to trace
their shadows with the magic hand of chance
and when i feel fair creature of an hour
that i shall never look upon thee more
never have relish in the faery power
of unreflecting love  then on the shore
of the wide world i stand alone and think
till love and fame to nothingness do sink
bright star would i were stedfast as thou art
not in lone splendour hung aloft the night
and watching with eternal lids apart
like nature's patient sleepless eremite
the moving waters at their priestlike task
of pure ablution round earth's human shores
or gazing on the new soft fallen mask
of snow upon the mountains and the moors
no  yet still stedfast still unchangeable
pillow'd upon my fair love's ripening breast
to feel for ever its soft fall and swell
awake for ever in a sweet unrest
still still to hear her tender taken breath
and so live ever or else swoon to death
at twenty five i cast my horoscope
and saw a future with all good things rife
a firm assurance of eternal life
in worlds beyond and in this world the hope
of deathless fame  but now my sun doth slope
to setting and the toil of sordid strife
the care of food and raiment child and wife
have dimmed and narrowed all my spirit's scope
eternal life    a river gulphed in sands
undying fame    a rainbow lost in clouds
what hope of immortality remains
but this  some soul that loves and understands
shall save thee from the darkness that enshrouds
and this  thy blood shall course in others' veins
more than a fleshly immortality
is mine  though i myself return again
to dust my qualities of heart and brain
of soul and spirit shall not cease to be
i view them growing day by day in thee
my first begotten son i trace them plain
in you my daughters and i count it gain
myself renewed and multiplied to see
but sadness mingles with my selfish joy
at thought of what you may be called to bear
oh passionate maid  oh glad impulsive boy
your father's sad experience you must share
self torture the unfeeling world's annoy
gross pleasure fierce exultance grim despair
cover me with your everlasting arms
ye guardian giants of this solitude
from the ill sight of men and from the rude
tumultuous din of yon wild world's alarms
oh knit your mighty limbs around above
and close me in for ever let me dwell
with the wood spirits in the darkest spell
that ever with your verdant locks ye wove
the air is full of countless voices joined
in one eternal hymn the whispering wind
the shuddering leaves the hidden water springs
the work song of the bees whose honeyed wings
hang in the golden tresses of the lime
or buried lie in purple beds of thyme
there's not a fibre in my trembling frame
that does not vibrate when thy step draws near
there's not a pulse that throbs not when i hear
thy voice thy breathing nay thy very name
when thou art with me every sense seems dim
and all i am or know or feel is thee
my soul grows faint my veins run liquid flame
and my bewildered spirit seems to swim
in eddying whirls of passion dizzily
when thou art gone there creeps into my heart
a cold and bitter consciousness of pain
the light the warmth of life with thee depart
and i sit dreaming over and over again
thy greeting clasp thy parting look and tone
and suddenly i wake  and am alone
lady whom my beloveacuted loves so well
when on his clasping arm thy head reclineth
when on thy lips his ardent kisses dwell
and the bright flood of burning light that shineth
in his dark eyes is poured into thine
when thou shalt lie enfolded to his heart
in all the trusting helplessness of love
if in such joy sorrow can find a part
oh give one sigh unto a doom like mine
which i would have thee pity but not prove
one cold calm careless wintry look that fell
haply by chance on one is all that he
ever gave my love round that my wild thoughts dwell
in one eternal pang of memory
i purposed once to take my pen and write
not songs like some tormented and awry
with passion but a cunning harmony
of words and music caught from glen and height
and lucid colours born of woodland light
and shining places where the sea streams lie
but this was when the heat of youth glowed white
and since i've put the faded purpose by
i have no faultless fruits to offer you
who read this book but certain syllables
herein are borrowed from unfooted dells
and secret hollows dear to noontide dew
and these at least though far between and few
may catch the sense like subtle forest spells
so take these kindly even though there be
some notes that unto jother lyres belong
stray echoes from the elder sons of song
and think how from its neighbouring native sea
the pensive shell doth borrow melody
i would not do the lordly masters wrong
by filching fair words from the shining throng
whose music haunts me as the wind a tree
lo when a stranger in soft syrian glooms
shot through with sunset treads the cedar dells
and hears the breezy ring of elfin bells
far down by where the white haired cataract booms
he faint with sweetness caught from forest smells
bears thence unwitting plunder of perfumes
peace hath an altar there the sounding feet
of thunder and the wildering wings of rain
against fire rifted summits flash and beat
and through grey upper gorges swoop and strain
but round that hallowed mountain spring remain
year after year the days of tender heat
and gracious nights whose lips with flowers are sweet
and filtered lights and lutes of soft refrain
a still bright pool to men i may not tell
the secrets that its heart of water knows
the story of a loved and lost repose
yet this i say to cliff and close leaved dell
a fitful spirit haunts yon limpid well
whose likeness is the faithless face of rose
today while yet the rumour filled the street
i left your faces troubled with the thought
of brothers to a bodeful fury wrought
and hurrying past a thousand twinkling feet
with clouded heart a solitude i sought
the haunt of many leaves  a cool retreat
and mused of strife with untold interest fraught
of homes of bloody battles to be fought
nor stirred till night rose stormy and the deep
moaned like some monster shaken in its sleep
then doleful sounds came up from lea and lynn
where rain fell heavy on the gloomy deep
as if the world so old and sick of sin
had turned her face into the dark to weep
when in the dark we slowly drift away
o'er unknown seas and busy thoughts at last
are quieted and all the cares are past
that bandit like infest the realms of day
to what pale country does the spirit stray
within what wan lit land what region vast
does this strange traveller journey far and fast
till in the east the day breaks cold and gray
ah tell me when we slumber whither goes
and whence at waking comes the silent guest
whose face no man hath seen whom no man knows
the dim familiar of each human breast
behold at length when day indeed shall close
will this uneasy traveller too have rest
love touch my mouth with kisses as with fire
lean hard against my breast that i may feel
from thy warm heart its influence subtly steal
through all my veins with overmuch desire
my spirit fainteth and my lips suspire
swiftly with heavy breathings round me reel
the shadows of the dark and downward wheel
the dim far stars from heaven draw me nigher
unto thy bosom love for all my sense
of earth and time fleets from me   dayward flows
the stream of night and into yon immense
blue void the slow moon fails hold me more close
lest from thine arms my spirit hasten hence
going that viewless way no mortal knows
go from me now i will no longer feel
your burning kisses on my fevered lips
you shall not hold one moment e'en the tips
of my shut fingers though you cry and kneel
my face aches and my tired senses reel
through all my veins a drowsy poison slips
my sight grows dim with gradual eclipse
for slumber on mine eyes has set his seal
get hence i will no more to night the bars
of love are placed against you now go while
i hate you not my roman the sick stars
wax faint and pallid in the dawn's red smile
look i am quenched in sleep as nenuphars
are quenched in the broad bosom of the nile
yea rock him gently in thine arms o deep
no nobler heart was ever hushed to rest
upon the chill soft pillow of thy breast
no truer eyes didst thou e'er kiss to sleep
while o'er his couch the wrathful billows leap
and mighty winds roar from the darkened west
still may his head on thy cool weeds be pressed
far down where thou dost endless silence keep
oh when slow moving through thy spaces dim
some scaly monster seeks its coral cave
and pausing o'er the sleeper stares with grim
dull eyes a moment downwards through the wave
then let thy pale green shadows curtain him
and swaying sea flowers hide his lonely grave
blown through the gusty spaces of the night
the pale clouds fleet like ghosts along the sky
a fitful wind goes moaning feebly by
and the faint moon poised o'er the craggy height
dies in its own uncertain misty light
within the hills the water springs are dry
the herbs are withered and the sand wastes lie
dim wide and lonely to the weary sight
behold her awful vigil she will keep
through the wan night as through the burning day
though all the world should sleep she will not sleep
but watch wild eyed and fierce to scare away
as round and round with hoarse low cries they creep
from her dead sons the hungry beasts of prey
my love is like the vastness of the sea
as deep as life as high as heaven is high
and pure as an unclouded summer sky
and as enduring as eternity
my love is that which was and is to be
which knows no change and which can never die
which all the wealth of ophir could not buy
yet free to one as light and air is free
o love thou putt'st to shame the nightingale
thy lips like bees are fraught with hydromel
than lilies are thy bosom is more pale
thy words are sweeter than a silver bell
yet time from thee thy beauties shall estrange
but this my love can never suffer change
lo in the valley love the galingale
bends to the blast beside the river shore
and autumn pipes forever more and more
while summer's slender voices faint and fail
lo now the liveried leaf grows sere and pale
a phantom of the glory gone before
and in the woodland walks we knew of yore
long since the songster ceased his tuneful tale
love let us love life's summer waneth soon
brief is the splendour of its fervent day
for every blood red rose of balmy june
hath burst a tender bud of early may
i unto thee would consecrate a boon
o shall we love or shall we still delay
in mary's absence reason gains his throne
and binds with stricter chains the struggling breast
scared at his angry frown and stern behest
love spreads his wings and flies with many a moan
when mary comes with vermeil tinctured cheek
with graceful mien and mirth awakening eye
prudence disarmed forsakes his ground to fly
and reason's chains as touched by magic break
thus when the chilling blast transforms to frost
the night born dews that bathe the polished glass
the roving eye in pleasing error lost
sees rock and woods crowd the fantastic mass
but soon as shines the sun's meridian ray
the icy prospect melts in streams away
the master saith look in thy heart and write
what thou hast heard the voices say within
the flashing rainbows and the mist the din
and avalanche of waters snowy white
of montmorency leaping down the height
i feel the throbbing of the joyous linn
keep time and measure with my pulses in
a thrilling symphony of sound and sight
for history poetry and wild romance
the old the new nature's exuberance
peace war and love  love still the best of all
their story here on every side i learn
and wolfe's and montcalm's rival camps discern
in the long thunder of the roaring fall
sweet  we will hold to love for love's sweet sake
seeing love to us must be his own reward
haply we shall not find our task too hard
nor suffer from intolerable ache
yea though henceforth our lives asunder break
from every comfort giving hope debarr'd
love may support his martyrs and the scarr'd
and wounded heart may triumph at the stake
sweet  not for us love's guerdons not for us
the boons which wont love's constancy requite
no whisper of low voices tremulous
kiss or caress no breath of love's delight
yet will we hold our joyless troth and thus
achieve love's victory in fate's despite
i have no wealth of grief no sobs no tears
not any sighs no words no overflow
nor storms of passion no reliefs yet oh
i have a leaden grief and with it fears
lest they who think there's nought where nought appears
may say i never loved him ah not so
love for him fills my heart if grief is slow
in utterance remember that for years
love was a habit and the grief is new
so new a thing it has no language yet
tears crowd my heart with eyes that are not wet
i watch the rain drops silent large and few
blotting a stone then comforted i take
those drops to be my tears shed for his sake
a sonnet is the body of a thought
which enters suddenly into the poet's mind
and breathes its way mysterious as the wind
unrecognised as first it was unsought
whilst yet unformed 'tis kindred to the naught
whence it arose the poet still must find
some spirit worthy shape in which to bind
the subtle life wherewith his mind is fraught
a stanza from the mental deep
rhymes well disposed with rhythm of even flow
full use of sense due length of limb it gives
a body fit the thought aroused from sleep
flushes the rhythm with a poetic glow
and in the sonnet's form for ever lives
great table mountain which i daily scan
with still increasing joy this morn was framed
in a low rainbow phoeligbus rightly aimed
just to include the outline in its span
and surely never since the world began
was nature's ruggedness more sweetly tamed
yet through my heart a sudden terror flamed
heaven's smile more dread inspires than earthly ban
such is the alchemy of sun and rain
touching earth's choicest dream of loveliness
it turned life's daily pleasure into awe
and pray what meant it nay i cannot guess
but all that is within me  soul heart brain
was dumbly glorified by what i saw
a child i chased the rainbow once and wept
because i could not reach its glorious ray
in life's decline i stood amid the spray
where all zambesi down its gorges leapt
and as into the cloud i careless stept
the rainbow forward moving came my way
with round completed on the grass it lay
and o'er my feet the rosy radiance crept
so do we chase our fancies and despair
at length of joys that made our youth so sweet
till some day god's ideal now unsought
bodies itself in some diviner air
and filling with its radiance all our thought
completes its circle at our very feet
only upon its tendrils blooms the vine
those tendrils by whose aid it soars aloft
and lifts its bannered leafage broad and soft
above the stronger elm its gold shoots twine
high up in the air in sweet mock martial line
as if its strength were all its own yet doff'd
of these its tendrils prone upon the croft
in barren weakness must it soon recline
only the tendril blooms only the flower
gives fruit and only for the fruit it brings
does the vine live the christian soul likewise
only in humble clinging finds its power
and like the master's vine piercing the skies
bears fruit in that alone whereby it clings
when first he came angels 'mid heavenly glow
by sweet compulsion drawn to earth to sing
made the clear welkin with their gloria ring
men wondering asked why sing ye here below
when from the mount they saw him upward go
his glad disciples stood a marvelling
as if their souls they after him would fling
angels in wonder asked why gaze ye so
thus near his presence both in wonder are
but once we see our god the mystery ends
where the sun rises there must be the morn
where the babe smiles or where our king ascends
thither all hearts are violently borne
and captive follow love's triumphal car
creator spirit lord of life and light
under thy brooding care the world began
through thee the elements together ran
and built up order from the void of night
through thee life darkling struggled into sight
then adding power to power placed in the van
a being soul endowed thy creature man
lifted by thee beyond all earthly height
o love who through this elemental strife
didst bring a universe to such increase
brood o'er the chaos of my sin fraught soul
let there be light in me let order life
reason and grace resume their sway and peace
subdue my little world from pole to pole
behold that dark brown chrysalis seeming dead
can such things live will life's reviving might
arouse this sleeper from so dark a night
yes see  there issues from its tomb like bed
a creature from whose airy wings are shed
bright beams of living many coloured light
thus have i seen a spirit take its flight
over its wings had error's meshes spread
the bonds of lie and prejudice and hell
and the beholder in an underbreath
sighed sadly as he whispered this is death
but no  a power thrills through the lifeless shell
and into glorious morn the spirit springs
the light of heaven gleaming from its wings
heaven's balance was all trembling when it eyed
mary unwonted trouble on her brow
confronting god with an imperial how
for once this once heaven hoped to be denied
nor hoped in vain to be no earthly bride
was always mary's gift to heaven and now
strong in the splendour of her virgin vow
she waives the motherhood of god aside
o queenly spirit o heart immaculate
this world contained no measure of thy worth
all other souls with inward strife are torn
thou wert so heavenly thy royal state
so towered supreme above the dross of earth
that even thy temptations were heaven born
strike fuller chords or let the music rest
of tender songs the world has yet no dearth
which scarce survive the moment of their birth
be thine in passionate cadences expressed
and banish morning glories from thy breast
a purple dream flower of the woods is worth
so little in the gardens of the earth
if gift thou givest give what we love best
since life is wild with tears and red with wrongs
let these red lilies typify thy songs
if with full flame thou would'st be comforted
since life is red with wrongs and wild with tears
oh move us haunt us kill our souls with fears
and we will praise thee  after thou art dead
your easy essays indicate a flow
dear friend of brain which we may elsewhere seek
and to their pages i and hundreds owe
that wednesday is the sweetest of the week
such observation wit and sense are shown
we think the days of bickerstaff return'd
and that a portion of that oil you own
in his undying midnight lamp which burn'd
i would not lightly bruise old priscian's head
or wronog the rules of grammar understood
but with the leave of priscian be it said
the indicative is your potential mood
wit poet prose man party man translator
h your best title yet is indicator
all unadvised and in an evil hour
lured by aspiring thoughts my son you doft
the lowly labours of the gentle craft
for lowly toils which blood and spirits sour
all things dear pledge are not in all men's power
the wiser sort of shrub affects the ground
the sweet content of mind is oftener found
in cobbler's parlour than in critic's bower
the sorest work is what doth cross the grain
and better to this hour you had been plying
the obsequious awl with well wax'd finger flying
than ceaseless thus to till a thankless vein
still teasing muses which are still denying
making a stretching leather of your brain
a timid grace sits trembling in her eye
as loth to meet the rudeness of men's sight
yet shedding a delicious lunar light
that steeps in kind oblivious ecstasy
the care crazed mind like some still melody
speaking most plain the thoughts which do possess
her gentle sprite peace and meek quietness
and innocent loves and maiden purity
a look whereof might heal the cruel smart
of changed friends or fortune's wrongs unkind
might to sweet deeds of mercy move the heart
of him who hates his brethren of mankind
turned are those lights from me who fondly yet
past joys vain loves and buried hopes regret
as when a child on some long winter's night
affrighted clinging to its grandam's knees
with eager wond'ring and perturbed delight
listens strange tales of fearful dark decrees
muttered to wretch by necromantic spell
or of those hags who at the witching time
of murky midnight ride the air sublime
and mingle foul embrace with fiends of hell
cold horror drinks its blood anon the tear
more gentle starts to hear the beldame tell
of pretty babes that loved each other dear
murdered by cruel uncle's mandate fell
ev'n such the shiv'ring joys thy tones impart
ev'n so thou siddons meltest my sad heart
queen bird that sittest on thy shining nest
and thy young cygnets without sorrow hatchest
and thou thou other royal bird that watchest
lest the white mother wandering feet molest
shrined are your offspring in a crystal cradle
brighter than helen's ere she yet had burst
her shelly prison they shall be born at first
strong active graceful perfect swan like able
to tread the land or waters with security
unlike poor human births conceived in sin
in grief brought forth both outwardly and in
confessing weakness error and impurity
did heavenly creatures own succession's line
the births of heaven like to yours would shine
the darkness brings no quiet here the light
no waking ever on my blinded brain
the flare of lights the rush and cry and strain
the engine's scream the hiss and thunder smite
i see the hurrying crowds the clasp the flight
faces that touch eyes that are dim with pain
i see the hoarse wheels turn and the great train
move labouring out into the boundless night
so many souls within its dim recesses
so many bright so many mournful eyes
mine eyes that watch grow fixed with dreams and guesses
what threads of life what hidden histories
what sweet or passionate dreams and dark distresses
what unknown thoughts what various agonies
oh city whom gray stormy hands have sown
with restless drift scarce broken now of any
out of the dark thy windows dim and many
gleam red across the storm sound is there none
save evermore the fierce wind's sweep and moan
from whose gray hands the keen white snow is shaken
in desperate gusts that fitfully lull and waken
dense as night's darkness round thy towers of stone
darkling and strange art thou thus vexed and chidden
more dark and strange thy veilegraved agony
city of storm in whose gray heart are hidden
what stormier woes what lives that groan and beat
stern and thin cheeked against time's heavier sleet
rude fates hard hearts and prisoning poverty
not to be conquered by these headlong days
but to stand free to keep the mind at brood
on life's deep meaning nature's altitude
of loveliness and time's mysterious ways
at every thought and deed to clear the haze
out of our eyes considering only this
what man what life what love what beauty is
this is to live and win the final praise
though strifes ill fortune and harsh human need
beat down the soul at moments blind and dumb
with agony yet patience  there shall come
many great voices from life's outer sea
hours of strange triumph and when few men heed
murmurs and glimpses of eternity
as one that for a weary space has lain
lulled by the song of circe and her wine
in gardens near the pale of proserpine
where that aeaean isle forgets the main
and only the low lutes of love complain
and only shadows of wan lovers pine
as such an one were glad to know the brine
salt on his lips and the large air again
so gladly from the songs of modern speech
men turn and see the stars and feel the free
shrill wind beyond the close of heavy flowers
and through the music of the languid hours
they hear like ocean on a western beach
the surge and thunder of the odyssey
old izaak in this angry age of ours
this hungry angry age how oft of thee
we dream and thy divine tranquillity
and all thy pleasure in the dewy flowers
the meads enamelled and the singing showers
and shelter of the silvery willow tree
by quiet waters of the river lea
ah happy hours we cry  ah halcyon hours
yet thou like we hadst trouble for this realm
of england for thy dear church mocked and rent
thy friends in beggary thy monarch slain
but naught could thy mild spirit overwhelm
ah father izaak teach us thy content
when time brings many a sorrow back again
the sacred keep of ilion is rent
with shaft and pit vague waters wander slow
through plains where simois and scamander went
to war with gods and heroes long ago
not yet to dark cassandra lying low
in rich mycenaelig do the fates relent
the bones of agamemnon are a show
and ruined is his royal monument
the awful dust and treasures of the dead
has learning scattered wide but vainly thee
homer she measures with her lesbian lead
and strives to rend thy songs too blind is she
to know the crown on thine immortal head
of indivisible supremacy
thou that on every field of earth and sky
didst hunt for death  that seemed to flee and fear
how great and greatly fallen dost thou lie
slain in the desert by some wandering spear
not here alas may england say  not here
nor in this quarrel was it meet to die
but in that dreadful battle drawing nigh
to shake the afghan passes strait and sheer
like aias by the ships shouldst thou have stood
and in some glen have stayed the stream of flight
the pillar of thy people and their shield
till helmund or till indus ran with blood
and back towards the northlands and the night
the stricken eagles scattered from the field
swift through some trap mine eyes have never found
dim panelled in the painted scene of sleep
thou giant harlequin of dreams dost leap
upon my spirit’s stage  then sight and sound
then space and time then language mete and bound
and all familiar forms that firmly keep
man’s reason in the road change faces peep
betwixt the legs and mock the daily round
yet thou canst more than mock sometimes my tears
at midnight break through bounden lids  a sign
thou hast a heart and oft thy little leaven
of dream taught wisdom works me bettered years
in one night witch saint trickster fool divine
i think thou’rt jester at the court of heaven
across the brook of time man leaping goes
on stepping stones of epochs that uprise
fixed memorable midst broad shallow flows
of neutrals kill times sleeps indifferencies
so mixt each morn and night rise salient heaps
some cross with but a zig zag jaded pace
from meal to meal some with convulsive leaps
shake the green tussocks of malign disgrace
and some advance by system and deep art
o’er vantages of wealth place learning tact
but thou within thyself dear manifold heart
dost bind all epochs in one dainty fact
oh sweet my pretty sum of history
i leapt the breadth of time in loving thee
the storm that snapped our fate’s one ship in twain
hath blown my half o’ the wreck from thine apart
o love o love across the gray waved main
to thee ward strain my eyes my arms my heart
i ask my god if e’en in his sweet place
where by one waving of a wistful wing
my soul could straightway tremble face to face
with thee with thee across the stellar ring
yea where thine absence i could ne’er bewail
longer than lasts that little blank of bliss
when lips draw back with recent pressure pale
to round and redden for another kiss
would not my lonesome heart still sigh for thee
what time that drear kiss intervals must be
so do the mottled formulas of sense
glide snakewise through our dreams of aftertime
so errors breed in reeds and grasses dense
that bank our singing rivulets of rhyme
by sense rule space and time but in god’s land
their intervals are not save such as lie
betwixt successive tones in concords bland
whose loving distance makes the harmony
ah there shall never come ‘twixt me and thee
gross dissonances of the mile the year
but in the multichords of ecstasy
our souls shall mingle yet be featured clear
and absence wrought to intervals divine
shall part yet link thy nature’s tone in mine
look down the shining peaks of all my days
base hidden in the valleys of deep night
so shalt thou see the heights and depths of praise
my love would render unto love’s delight
for i would make each day an alp sublime
of passionate snow white hot yet icy clear
one crystal of the true loves of all time
spiring the world’s prismatic atmosphere
and i would make each night an awful vale
deep as thy soul obscure as modesty
with every star in heaven trembling pale
o’er sweet profounds where only love can see
oh runs not thus the lesson thou hast taught
when life’s all love ‘tis life aught else ‘tis naught
let no man say he at his lady’s feet
lays worship that to heaven alone belongs
yea swings the incense that for god is meet
in flippant censers of light lover’s songs
who says it knows not god nor love nor thee
for love is large as is yon heavenly dome
in love’s great blue each passion is full free
to fly his favourite flight and build his home
did e’er a lark with sky ward pointing beak
stab by mischance a level flying dove
wife love flies level his dear mate to seek
god love darts straight into the skies above
crossing the windage of each other’s wings
but speeds them both upon their journeyings
now at thy soft recalling voice i rise
where thought is lord o’er time’s complete estate
like as a dove from out the gray sedge flies
to tree tops green where coos his heavenly mate
from these clear coverts high and cool i see
how every time with every time is knit
and each to all is mortised cunningly
and none is sole or whole yet all are fit
thus if this age but as a comma show
‘twixt weightier clauses of large worded years
my calmer soul scorns not the mark i know
this crooked point time’s complex sentence clears
yet more i learn while friend i sit by thee
who sees all time sees all eternity
by the more height of thy sweet stature grown
twice eyed with thy gray vision set in mine
i ken far lands to wifeless men unknown
i compass stars for one sexed eyes too fine
no text on sea horizons cloudily writ
no maxim vaguely starred in fields or skies
but this wise thou in me deciphers it
oh thou’rt the height of heights the eye of eyes
not hardest fortune’s most unbounded stress
can bind my soul nor hurl it from on high
possessing thee the self of loftiness
and very light that sight discovers by
howe’er thou turn’st wrong earth still love’s in sight
for we are taller than the breadth of night
they said of her she never can have felt
the sorrows that our deeper natures feel
they said her placid lips have never spelt
hard lessons taught by pain her eyes reveal
no passionate yearning no perplexed appeal
to other eyes love and her heart have dealt
with her but lightly  when the pilgrims dwelt
first on these shores lest savage hands should steal
to precious graves with desecrating tread
the burial field was with the ploughshare crossed
and there the maize her silken tresses tossed
with thanks those pilgrims ate their bitter bread
while peaceful harvests hid what they had lost
what if her smiles concealed from you her dead
a book of sonnets here are letters taken
from life's illuminated alphabet
some in a grey ground some in scarlet set
some in a dust of starry spangles shaken
from midnight skies others there be that waken
to a strange life of their own and so forget
the hand's cunning that made them stranger yet
than any lived since eden was forsaken
here is a crystal here a star a flower
and here a voice like a great organ tone
that shapes itself that shines unveils a face
fair as a face in dreams that in its hour
makes wondrous music each living its own
life perfect with inimitable grace
but thou hast read how cleopatra went
to antony her lustrous eyes a shine
through mazy webs of love fit to entwine
a simple conqueror palaced in a tent
and how her pearl a monnrch's ransom blent
its iridescence with the sharp white wine
to pleasure her as with an air divine
she quaffed it to the roman's dazzlement
in such wise make and take a sonnet throw
into the wine emotion the pure pearl
of artistry and while 'tis yet a swirl
and beading bravely snare with subtile craft
a gleam of golden light upon it  so
then breathless drain it at a single draught
here fix the tablet this must be the place
where our columbus of the south did land
he saw the indian village on that sand
and on this rock first met the simple race
of austral indians who presumed to face
with lance and spear his musket close at hand
is the clear stream from which his vent'rous band
refreshed their ship and thence a little space
lies sutherland their shipmate for the sound
of christian burial better did proclaim
possession than the flag in england's name
these were the commelinae banks first found
but where's the tree with the ship's wood carved fame
fix then the ephesian brass  'tis classic ground
this month is just the moral uv a tart
that kim up to the station i wus at
a boshter tabby not too thin ner fat
en watto fer a hottie  ut the start
she didn't kid yer long  'er bloomin' dart
ud git yer goin' till yer 'ad a rat
en then she'd sane yer wif ring orf o' that
yer ain't got buckley's fur me 'and en 'eart
that's march's way it gets the break uv 'eat

erbout the finish uv a smoodgin' meet
then 'fore it's over w'ere the sunbjlaze shone
down hughie pours en summer's limp en beat
un takes the offis straight it mus' be gone
not like the brazen giant of greek fame
with conquering limbs astride from land to land
here at our sea washed sunset gates shall stand
a mighty woman with a torch whose flame
is the imprisoned lightning and her name
mother of exiles from her beacon hand
glows world wide welcome her mild eyes command
the air bridged harbor that twin cities frame
keep ancient lands your storied pomp cries she
with silent lips give me your tired your poor
your huddled masses yearning to breathe free
the wretched refuse of your teeming shore
send these the homeless tempest tost to me
i lift my lamp beside the golden door
thou two faced year mother of change and fate
didst weep when spain cast forth with flaming sword
the children of the prophets of the lord
prince priest and people spurned by zealot hate
hounded from sea to sea from state to state
the west refused them and the east abhorred
no anchorage the known world could afford
close locked was every port barred every gate
then smiling thou unveil'dst o two faced year
a virgin world where doors of sunset part
saying ho all who weary enter here
there falls each ancient barrier that the art
of race or creed or rank devised to rear
grim bulwarked hatred between heart and heart
i see it as it looked one afternoon
in august  by a fresh soft breeze o'erblown
the swiftness of the tide the light thereon
a far off sail white as a crescent moon
the shining waters with pale currents strewn
the quiet fishing smacks the eastern cove
the semi circle of its dark green grove
the luminous grasses the merry sun
in the grave sky the sparkle far and wide
laughter of unseen children cheerful chirp
of crickets and low lisp of rippling tide
light summer clouds fantastical as sleep
changing unnoted while i gazed thereon
all these fair sounds and sights i made my own
late born and woman souled i dare not hope
the freshness of the elder lays the might
of manly modern passion shall alight
upon my muse's lips nor may i cope
who veiled and screened by womanhood must grope
with the world's strong armed warriors and recite
the dangers wounds and triumphs of the fight
twanging the full stringed lyre through all its scope
but if thou ever in some lake floored cave
o'erbrowed by rocks a wild voice wooed and heard
answering at once from heaven and earth and wave
lending elf music to thy harshest word
misprize thou not these echoes that belong
to one in love with solitude and song
last night i slept and when i woke her kiss
still floated on my lips for we had strayed
together in my dream through some dim glade
where the shy moonbeams scarce dared light our bliss
the air was dank with dew between the trees
the hidden glow worms kindled and were spent
cheek pressed to cheek the cool the hot night breeze
mingled ouir hair our breath and came and went
as sporting with our passion low and deep
spake in mine ear her voice and didst thou dream
this could be buried this could be sleep
and love be thrall to death nay whatso seem
have faith dear heart this is the thing that is
thereon i woke and on my lips her kiss
music and silver chimes and sunlit air
freighted with the scent of honeyed orange flower
glad friendly festal faces everywhere
she rapt from all in this unearthly hour
with cloudlike cast back veil and faint flushed cheek
in bridal beauty moves as in a trance
alone with him and fears to breathe to speak
lest the rare subtle spell dissolve perchance
but he upon that floral head looks down
noting the misty eyes the grave sweet brow
doubts if her bliss be perfect as his own
and dedicates anew with inward vow
his soul unto her service to repay
richly the sacrifice she yields this day
the bird sits spelled upon the lithe brown wrist
of yonder turbaned fowler who had lamed
no feather limb but the winged spirit tamed
with his compelling eye he need not trust
the silken coil not set the thick limed snare
he lures the wanderer with his steadfast gaze
it shrinks it quails it trembles yet obeys
and lo he has enslaved the thing of air
the fixed insistent human will is lord
of all the earth  but in the awful sky
reigns absolute unreached by deed or word
above creation through eternity
outshining the sun's shield the lightening's sword
the might of allah's unaverted eye
as when a father dies his children draw
about the empty hearth their loss to cheat
with uttered praise  love  oft repeat
his all familiar words with whispered awe
the honored habit of his daily law
not for his sake but theirs whose feeble feet
need still that guiding lamp whose faith less sweet
misses that tempered patience without flaw
so do we gather round thy vacant chair
in thine own elm roofed amber rivered town
master  father for the love we bear
not for thy fame's sake do we weave this crown
and feel thy presence in the sacred air
forbidding us to weep that thou art gone
down the long hall she glistens like a star
the foam born mother of love transfixed to stone
yet none the less immortal breathing on
time's brutal hand hath maimed but could not mar
when first the enthralled enchantress from afar
dazzled mine eyes i saw not her alone
serenely poised on her world worshipped throne
as when she guided once her dove drawn car
but at her feet a pale death stricken jew
her life adorer sobbed farewell to love
here heine wept  here still he weeps anew
nor ever shall his shadow lift or move
while mourns one ardent heart one poet brain
for vanished hellas and hebraic plain
oft have i brooded on defeat and pain
the pathos of the stupid stumbling throng
these i ignore to day and only long
to pour my soul forth in one trumpet strain
one clear grief shattering triumphant song
for all the victories of man's high endeavor
palm bearing laureled deeds that live forever
the splendor clothing him whose will is strong
hast thou beheld the deep glad eyes of one
who has persisted and achieved  rejoice
on naught diviner shines the all seeing sun
salute him with free heart and choral voice
'midst flippant feeble crowds of spectres wan
the bold significant successful man
a dream of interlinking hands of feet
tireless to spin the unseen fairy woof
of the entangling waltz  bright eyebeams meet
gay laughter echoes from the vaulted roof
warm perfumes rise the soft unflickering glow
of branching lights sets off the changeful charms
of glancing gems rich stuffs the dazzling snow
of necks unkerchieft and bare clinging arms
hark to the music  how beneath the strain
of reckless revelry vibrates and sobs
one fundamental chord of constant pain
the pulse beat of the poet's heart that throbs
so yearns though all the dancing waves rejoice
the troubled sea's disconsolate deep voice
who shall proclaim the golden fable false
of orpheus' miracles  this subtle strain
above our prose world's sordid loss and gain
lightly uplifts us with the rhythmic waltz
the lyric prelude the nocturnal song
of love and languor varied visions rise
that melt and blend to our enchanted eyes
the polish poet who sleeps silenced long
the seraph souled musician breathes again
eternal eloquence immortal pain
revived the exalted face we know so well
the illuminated eyes the fragile frame
slowly consuming with its inward flame
we stir not speak not lest we break the spell
a voice was needed sweet and true and fine
as the sad spirit of the evening breeze
throbbing with human passion yet devine
as the wild bird's untutored melodies
a voice for him 'neath twilight heavens dim
who mourneth for his dead while round him fall
the wan and noiseless leaves  a voice for him
who sees the first green sprout who hears the call
of the first robin on the first spring day
a voice for all whom fate hath set apart
who still misprized must perish by the way
longing with love for that they lack the art
of their own soul's expression  for all these
sing the unspoken hope the vague sad reveries
then nature shaped a poet's heart  a lyre
from out whose chords the lightest breeze that blows
drew trembling music wakening sweet desire
how shall she cherish him  behold  she throws
this precious fragile treasure in the whirl
of seething passions he is scourged and stung
must dive in storm vext seas if but one pearl
of art or beauty therefrom may be wrung
no pure browed pensive nymph his muse shall be
an amazon of thought with sovereign eyes
whose kiss was poison man brained worldy wise
inspired that elfin delicate harmony
rich gain for us  but with him is it well
the poet who must sound earth heaven and hell
blue storm clouds in hot heavens of mid july
hung heavy brooding over land and sea
our hearts a tremble throbbed in harmony
with the wild restless tone of air and sky
shall we not call im prospero who held
in his enchanted hands the fateful key
of that tempestuous hour's mystery
and with controlling wand our spirits spelled
with him to wander by a sun bright shore
to hear fine fairy voices and to fly
with disembodied ariel once more
above earth's wrack and ruin  far and nigh
the laughter of the thunder echoed loud
and harmless lightnings leapt from cloud to cloud
floating upon a swelling wave of sound
we seemed to overlook an endless sea
poised 'twixt clear heavens and glittering surf were we
we drank the air in flight  we knew no bound
to the audacious ventures of desire
nigh us the sun was dropping drowned in gold
deep deep below the burning billows rolled
and all the sea sang like a smitten lyre
oh the wild voices of those chanting waves
the human faces glimpsed beneath the tide
familiar eyes gazed from profound sea caves
and we exalted were as we had died
we knew the sea was life the harmonious cry
the blended discords of humanity
look deeper yet  mark 'midst the wave blurred mass
in lines distinct in colors clear defined
the typic groups and figures of mankind
behold within the cool and liquid glass
bright child folk sporting with smooth yellow shells
astride of dolphins leaping up to kiss
fair mother faces  from the vast abyss
how joyously their thought free laughter wells
some slumber in grim caverns unafraid
lulled by the overwhelming water's sound
and some make mouths at dragons undismayed
oh dauntless innocence  the gulfs profound
reeumlcho strangely with their ringing glee
and with wise mermaids' plaintive melody
what do the sea nymphs in that coral cave
with wondering eyes their supple forms they bend
o'er something rarely beautiful  they lend
their lithe white arms and through the golden wave
they lift it tenderly  oh blinding sight
a naked radiant goddess tranced in sleep
full limbed voluptuous 'neath the mantling sweep
of auburn locks that kiss her ankles white
upward they bear her chanting low and sweet
the clinging waters part before their way
jewels of flame are dancing 'neath their feet
up in the sunshine on soft foam they lay
their precious burden and return forlorn
oh bliss  oh anguish  mortals love is born
hark  from unfathomable deeps a dirge
swells sobbing through the melancholy air
where love has entered death is also there
the wail outrings the chafed tumultuous surge
ocean and earth the illimitable skies
prolong one note a mourning for the dead
the cry of souls not to be comforted
what piercing music  funeral visions rise
and send the hot tears raining down our cheek
we see the silent grave upon the hill
with its lone lilac bush  o heart be still
she will not rise she will not stir nor speak
surely the unreturning dead are blest
ring on sweet dirge and knell us to our rest
upon the silver beach the undines dance
with interlinking arms and flying hair
like polished marble gleam their limbs left bare
upon their virgin rites pale moonbeams glance
softer the music  for their foam bright feet
print not the moist floor where they trip their round
affrighted they will scatter at a sound
leap in their cool sea chambers nibly fleet
and we shall doubt that we have ever seen
while our sane eyes behold stray wreaths of mist
shot with faint colors by the moon rays kissed
floating snow soft snow white where these had been
already look  the wave washed sands are bare
and mocking laughter ripples through the air
divided 'twixt the dream world and the real
we heard the waxing passion of the song
soar as to scale the heavens on pinions strong
amidst the long reverberant thunder peal
against the rain blurred square of light the head
of the pale poet at the lyric keys
stood boldly cut absorbed in reveries
while over it keen bladed lightnings played
rage on wild storm the music seemed to sing
not all the thunders of thy wrath can move
the soul that's dedicate to worshipping
eternal beauty everlasting love
no more  the song was ended and behold
a rainbow trembling on a sky of gold
forth in the sunlit rain bathed air we stepped
sweet with the dripping grass and flowering vine
and saw through irised clouds the pale sun shine
back o'er the hills the rain mist slowly crept
like a transparent curtain's silvery sheen
and fronting us the painted bow was arched
whereunder the majestic cloud shapes marched
in the wet yellow light the dazzling green
of lawn and bush and tree seemed stained with blue
our hearts o'erflowed with peace  with smiles we spake
of partings in the past of courage new
of high achievement of the dreams that make
a wonder and a glory of our days
and all life's music but a hymn of praise
paris from throats of iron silver brass
joy thundering cannon blent with chiming bells
and martial strains the full voiced paeligan swells
the air is starred with flags the chanted mass
throngs all the churches yet the broad streets swarm
with glad eyed groups who chatter laugh and pass
in holiday confusion class with class
and over all the spring the sun floods warm
in the imperial palace that march morn
the beautiful young mother lay and smiled
for by her side just breathed the prince her child
heir to an empire to the purple born
crowned with the titan's name that stirs the heart
like a blown clarion  one more bonaparte
born to the purple lying stark and dead
transfixed with poisoned spears beneath the sun
of brazen africa thy grave is one
fore fated youth on whom were visited
follies and sins not thine whereat the world
heartless howe'er it be will pause to sing
a dirge to breathe a sigh a wreath to fling
of rosemary and rue with bay leaves curled
enmeshed in toils ambitious not thine own
immortal loved boy prince thou tak'st thy stand
with early doomed don carlos hand in hand
with mild browed arthur geoffrey's murdered son
louis the dauphin lifts his thorn ringed head
and welcomes thee his brother 'mongst the dead
so calchas on the sacred palatine
you thought of mopsus and o'er wastes of sea
a flower brought your message  i divine
through my deep art the kindly mockery
that played about your lips and in your eyes
plucking the frail leaf while you dreamed of home
thanks for the silent greeting  i shall prize
beyond june's rose the scentless flower of rome
all the campagna spreads before my sight
the mouldering wall the caesars' tombs unwreathed
rome and the tiber and the yellow light
wherein the honey colored blossom breathed
but most i thank it  egoists that we be
for proving then and there you thought of me
there was a man who watched the river flow
past the huge town one gray november day
round him in narrow high piled streets at play
the boys made merry as they saw him go
murmuring half loud with eyes upon the stream
the immortal screed he held within his hand
for he was walking in an april land
with faust and helen  shadowy as a dream
was the prose world the river and the town
wild joy possessed him through enchanted skies
he saw the cranes of ibycus swoop down
he closed the page he lifted up his eyes
lo  a black line of birds in wavering thread
bore him the greetings of the deathless dead
no man had ever heard a nightingale
when once a keen eyed naturalist was stirred
to study and define  what is a bird
to classify by rote and book nor fail
to mark its structure and to note the scale
whereon its song might possibly be heard
thus far no farther  so he spake the word
when of a sudden  hark the nightingale
oh deeper higher than he could divine
that all unearthly untaught strain  he saw
the plain brown warbler unabashed not mine
he cried the error of this fatal flaw
no bird is this it soars beyond my line
were it a bird 'twould answer to my law
when the vexed hubbub of our world of gain
roars round about me as i walk the street
the myriad noise of traffic and the beat
of toil's incessant hammer the fierce strain
of struggle hand to hand and brain to brain
ofttimes a sudden dream my sense will cheat
the gaudy shops the sky piled roofs retreat
and all at once i stand enthralled again
within a marble minster over seas
i watch the solemn gold stained gloom that creeps
to kiss an alabaster tomb where sleeps
a lady 'twixt two knights' stone effigies
and every day in dusky glory steeps
their sculptured slumber of five centuries
not while the fever of the blood is strong
the heart throbs loud the eyes are veiled no less
with passion than with tears the muse shall bless
the poet sould to help and soothe with song
not then she bids his trembling lips express
the aching gladness the voluptuous pain
life is his poem then flesh sense and brain
one full stringed lyre attuned to happiness
but when the dream is done the pulses fail
the day's illusion with the day's sun set
he lonely in the twilight sees the pale
divine consoler featured like regret
enter and clasp his hand and kiss his brow
then his lips ope to sing  as mine do now
therefore i dare reveal my private woe
the secret blots of my imperfect heart
nor strive to shrink or swell mine own desert
nor beautify nor hide  for this i know
that even as i am thou also art
thou past heroic forms unmoved shalt go
to pause and bide with me to whisper low
not i alone am weak not i apart
must suffer struggle conquer day by day
here is my very cross by strangers borne
here is my bosom sin wherefrom i pray
hourly deliverance  this my rose my thorn
this woman my soul's need can understand
stretching o'er silent gulfs her sister hand
as the blind milton's memory of light
the deaf beethoven's phantasy of tone
wroght joys for them surpassing all things known
in our restricted sphere of sound and sight
so while the glaring streets of brick and stone
vix with heat noise and dust from morn till night
i will give rein to fancy taking flight
from dismal now and here and dwell alone
with new enfranchised senses all day long
think ye 't is i who sit 'twixt darkened walls
while ye chase beauty over land and sea
uplift on wings of some rare poet's song
where the wide billow laughs and leaps and falls
i soar cloud high free as the winds are free
who grasps the substance who 'mid shadows strays
he who within some dark bright wood reclines
'twixt sleep and waking where the needled pines
have cushioned al his couch with soft brown sprays
he notes not how the living water shines
trembling along the cliff a flickering haze
brimming a wine bright pool nor lifts his gaze
to read the ancient wonders and the signs
does he possess the actual or do i
who paint on air more than his sense receives
the glittering pine tufts with closed eyes behold
breathe the strong resinous perfume see the sky
quiver like azure flame between the leaves
and open unseen gates with key of gold
the fervent pale faced mother ere she sleep
looks out upon the zigzag lighted square
the beautiful bare trees the blue night air
the revelation of the star strewn deep
world above world and heaven over heaven
between the tree tops and the skies her sight
rests on a steadfast ruddy shining light
high in the tower an earthly star of even
hers is the faith in saints' and angels' power
and mediating love  she breathes a prayer
for yon tired watcher in the gray old tower
he the shrewd skeptic poet unaware
feels comforted and stilled and knows not whence
falls this unwonted peace on heart and sense
well nigh two thousand years hath israel
suffered the scorn of man for love of god
endured the outlaw's ban the yoke the rod
with perfect patience  empires rose and fell
around him nebo was adored and bel
edom was drunk with victory and trod
on his high places while the sacred sod
was desecrated by the infidel
his faith proved steadfast without breach or flaw
but now the last renouncement is required
his truth prevails his god is god his law
is found the wisdom most to be desired
not his the glory  he maligned misknown
bows his meek head and says thy will be done
how calmly drops the dew on tree and plant
while round each pendulous leaf the cool airs blow
the neighbour city has no sign to show
of all its grim machines that toil and pant
except a sky that coal makes confidant
but there the human rivers ebb and flow
and thither was i wonted once to go
with heart not ill at ease or recusant
here now i love to wander morn and eve
till oaks and elms have grown oracular
yet conscious that my soberest thoughts receive
a tinge of tumult from the smoke afar
and scarcely know to which i most belong
the simple fields or that unsimple throng
my heart's ideal that somewhere out of sight
art beautiful and gracious and alone
haply where blue saronic waves are blown
on shores that keep some touch of old delight
how welcome thy memory and how bright
to one who watches over leagues of stone
these chilly northern waters creep and moan
from weary morning unto weary night
o shade form lovelier than the living crowd
so kind to votaries yet thyself unvowed
so free to human fancies fancy free
my vagrant thought goes out to thee to thee
as wandering lonelier than the poet's cloud
i listen to the wash of this dull sea
i've viewed the pit where as in scorn were thrown
the bones of chatterton and here i see
where first the muses marked him for their own
emerging from the dawn of infancy
children he once was blithe as now ye are
the life beam glittering in his ardent eye
but guilt and melancholy and despair
pointing their future prey passed darkling by
ah what is genius it is a burning brand
like that the cherub bore to guard the way
to paradise if grace support the hand
that wields it then its radiant flame shall play
in glory round else shall its lightnings burst
and strike their victim down  scathed and accursed
bay of the mount whose opening coasts are spread
from mousehole island to the twin starred lizard
whose waves are speckled with the mullet red
from head to tail all good  except the gizzard
whose sons the patriotic flame display
which warmed the breast of hampdens and of sidneys
whose sloping headlands with potatoes gay
bloom with the scarlet robe and silvery kidneys
o land of yellow ling and powdered hake
o cornucopia of clouted cream
o nurse of matrons skilled the pie to bake
beneath the furze fired kettle not a ream
of folio paper from the stores of hewett
if i could write thy praise would give me room to do it
an angel's wing is waving over their head
while they the brother and the sister walk
nor dare as heedless of its fanning talk
of woes which are not buried with the dead
hand clasped in hand they move adown their cheek
from the full heart spring tears overflowing gush
close and more close they clasp as if to speak
would wake the sorrows which they seek to hush
down to the mansion slow their footsteps tend
where blank despair is soothed by mercy's spell
pausing in momentary prayer to bend
ere the cheered sister passes to her cell
sure in the hope that yet there will be given
calm and sweet hours of peace  foretastes of heaven
coleridge of boyhood in the early dawn
oppressed i felt not nor of hope forlorn
grasping your hand you spoke as though our school
were of a separate world the vestibule
and we its habitants  in cloistered walk
while such of opening scenes your cherished talk
i listened breathless  and i saw you prove
your boded triumphs in the college grove
thence by a sudden plunge amid their strife
you sprang into the waves of this world's life
nor paused  far far away it was mine to hear
fame of your struggles and the applauding cheer
at last of wondrous boy of bard of sage
sank beneath friendship's roof the sheltered age
a link boy once dick hellfinch stood the grin
at charing cross he long his bawling plied
here light here light your honour for a win
to every cull and drab he loudly cried
in leicester fields as most his story know
come black your worship for a single mag
and while he shined his nelly sacked the bag
and thus they sometimes stagged a precious go
in smithfields too where graziers oft resort
dick loitered there to take in men of cash
with cards and dice was up to every sport
and at salt petre bank would cut a dash
at every knowing rig in every gang
dick hellfinch was the pink of all the slang
ambitious views never fired my lowly breast
contented competence to me a throne
in some sequestered vale my head to rest
and on some kindred heart repose my own
to share such toil as gives to ease its zest
such temperate mirth as wisdom's self might own
a cot within with smiles and neatness dressed
without with fragrant woodbine overgrown
secure to please the sweetest task confessed
the aim to please entirely one alone
with love and peace and union to be blessed
by fashion's slaves unnoticed and unknown
to have a little for the more distressed
and with kind deeds the want of wealth atone
they trod the streets and squares where now i tread
with weary hearts a little while ago
when thin and grey the melancholy snow
clung to the leafless branches overhead
or when the smoke veiled sky grew stormy red
in autumn with a re arisen woe
wrestled what time the passionate spring winds blow
and paced scorched stones in summer  they are dead
the sorrow of their souls to them did seem
as real as mine to me as permanent
to day it is the shadow of a dream
the half forgotten breath of breezes spent
so shall another soothe his woe supreme
no more he comes who this way came and went
two terrors fright my soul by night and day
the first is life and with her come the years
a weary winding train of maidens they
with forward fronting eyes too sad for tears
upon whose kindred faces blank and grey
the shadow of a kindred woe appears
death is the second terror who shall say
what form beneath the shrouding mantle nears
which way she turn my soul finds no relief
my smitten soul may not be comforted
alternately she swings from grief to grief
and poised between them sways from dread to dread
for there she dreads because she knows  and here
because she knows not only faints with fear
back to the mystic shore beyond the main
the mystic craft has sped and left no trace
ah nevermore may she behold his face
nor touch his hand nor hear his voice again
with hidden front she crouches all in vain
the proffered balm a vessel nears the place
they bring her young lost brother see her strain
the new found nurseling in a close embrace
god we have lost thee with much questioning
in vain we seek thy trace by sea and land
and in thine empty fanes where no men sing
what shall we do through all the weary days
thus wail we and lament our eyes we raise
and lo our brother with an outstretched hand
now is the perfect moment of the year
half naked branches half a mist of green
vivid and delicate the slopes appear
the cool soft air is neither fierce nor keen
and in the temperate sun we feel no fear
of all the hours which shall be and have been
it is the briefest as it is most dear
it is the dearest as the shortest seen
o it was best beloveacuted at the first
our hands met gently and our meeting sight
was steady on our senses scarce had burst
the faint fresh fragrance of the new delight
i seek that clime unknown without a name
where first and best and last shall be the same
most wonderful and strange it seems that i
who but a little time ago was tost
high on the waves of passion and of pain
with aching heart and wildly throbbing brain
who peered into the darkness deeming vain
all things there found if but one thing were lost
thus calm and still and silent here should lie
watching and waiting  waiting passively
the dark has faded and before mine eyes
have long grey flats expanded dim and bare
and through the changing guises all things wear
inevitable law i recognise
yet in my heart a hint of feeling lies
which half a hope and half is a despair
the stars come out the fragrant shadows fall
about a dreaming garden still and sweet
i hear the unseen bats above me bleat
among the ghostly moths their hunting call
and twinkling glow worms all about me crawl
now for a chamber dim a pillow meet
for slumbers deep as death a faultless sheet
cool white and smooth so may i reach the hall
with poppies strewn where sleep that is so dear
with magic sponge can wipe away an hour
or twelve and make them naught why not a year
why could a man not loiter in that bower
until a thousand painless cycles wore
and then  what if it held him evermore
reign on majestic ville marie
spread wide thy ample robes of state
the heralds cry that thou art great
and proud are thy young sons of thee
mistress of half a continent
thou risest from thy girlhood's rest
we see thee conscious heave thy breast
and feel thy rank and thy descent
spring of the saint and chevalier
and with the scarlet tunic wed
mount royal's crown upon thy head
and past thy footstool broad and clear
saint lawrence sweeping to the sea
reign on majestic ville marie
how happy he who by fine cultured art
plies him a line upon a silvery stream
takes him therefrom a newly ventured theme
and fair to speak hath change of mind and heart
whose gentle wrist shall to a fly impart
semblance to living  being so shall seem
to the brook eyes nor fancy nor a dream
and so beguile by crafty counterpart
he shall of faith in ample store be given
wedlock to peace  the hand of darling joy
sunshinest mood  the cleansing spirit of heaven
and so betimes due gracefulness employ
for him the gods shall favor and repay
make life and death all one a golden day
him did high virtue perfectly endow
clean wrought for living  nature's gifted sage
uncoverer of beauty on time's gilded page
fine priest of streams of leaf and drooping bough
keeper of gladness faith's own solemn vow
eschewing gain and competition's rage
measuring life by heaven's wiser gauge
and breathing hope and blessedness enow
oh i have been much in delight to think
how well his days were chosen to be spent
and by the pools of stafford 'proached the brink
of paradise  and comfortably lent
him to sweet themes of chaste divinity
kind songs of hope on skyward wings set free
ah life that mystery that no man knows
and all men ask the arab from his sands
the caesar's self lifting imperial hands
and the lone dweller where the lotus blows
o'er trackless tropics and o'er silent snows
she dumbly broods that sphinx of all the lands
and if she answers no man understands
and no cry breaks the blank of her repose
but a new form dawned once upon my pain
with grave sad lips yet in the eyes a smile
of deepest meaning dawning sweet and slow
lighting to service and no more in vain
i ask of life what art thou as erewhile
for since love holds my hand i seem to know
the woods that summer loved are grey and bare
the sombre trees stretch up their arms on high
in mute appeal against the leaden sky
a flurry faint of snow is in the air
all day the clouds have hung in heavy fold
above the valley where grey shadows steal
and i who sit and watch them seem to feel
a touch of sadness as the day grows old
but o'er my fancy comes a tender face
a dream of curls that float like sunlight golden
a subtle fragrance filling all the place
the whisper of a story that is olden
till breaks the sun through dull december skies
and all the world is springtime in the deep blue of her eyes
dismal november me it soothes to view
at parting day the scanty foliage fall
from the wet fruit tree or the grey stone wall
whose cold films glisten with unwholesome dew
to watch the yellow mists from the dank earth
enfold the neighbouring copse while on as they pass
the silent rain drops bend the long rank grass
which wraps some blossom's unmatureacuted birth
and through my cot's lone lattice glimmering grey
thy damp chill evenings have a charm for me
dismal november for strange vacancy
summoneth then my very heart away
till from mist hidden spire comes the slow knell
and says that in the still air death doth dwell
ah quiet day i oft recall the time
when i did chase my childish sluggishness
the rear of darkness lingering still  to dress
in due sort for thy coming the first chime
of blithesome bells that ushered in the morn
carolled to me of rest and simplest mirth
it was then all happiness on the wide earth
to gaze i little dreamt that man was born
for aught but wholesome toil and holiest praise
thanking that god who made him to rejoice
but i am changeacuted now nor could i raise
my sunken spirit at thy well known voice
but that thou seemest soothingly to say
look up poor mourner to a better day
is not all nature smiling why should i
pine with the agonies of wretchedness
this active life excites that vanity
and him the fervours of affection bless
ambition beckoning waves her banners high
streaming with rays of glory and success
and on the wings of folly thousands fly
to grasp the toy of hourly happiness
dejection presses me with power like fate
in fellowship with woe and inward care
the beauteous forms of nature wrought so fair
sink on my spirits with a weary weight
nor active life less threatens with despair
there flourish insincerity and hate
in such a day how calm and mild this scene
made for poetic thought the woods displayed
of brown and yellow every varying shade
and here and there the fresh and lingering green
told yet of summer and her days serene
too soon departed fading fern arrayed
the russet hills and as faint sun gleams strayed
in warmer hues the upland slopes were seen
oh beauteous aspect of a beauteous world
mournful to think how little understood
in man's distempered heart hath frenzy hurled
envenomed shafts the sword defiled with blood
lays waste the earth and over the ocean flood
the crimson flag of discord is unfurled
where is that crowd of friends that could dispense
refreshing rapture to life's sunny morn
where are those loves affections that are born
of freedom sentiment and confidence
it is silent all a blank to every sense
the energy of life that used to scorn
the rule of pale experience is withdrawn
that power erewhile so buoyant and intense
yet there is one who faithful still remains
who loves my solitude as once she loved
my cheer in social life who loves my joy
nor flies my couch when gnawing sickness reigns
she like the minister of heaven hath proved
that time and chance can true love never destroy
macready thou hast pleased me much till now
and yet i would not thy fine powers arraign
i did not think thou hadst that livelier vein
nor that clear open spirit on thy brow
come i will crown thee with apollo's bough
mine is a humble branch yet not in vain
given if the few i sing shall not disdain
to wear the little wreaths that i bestow
there is a buoyant air a passionate tone
that breathes about thee lighting up thine eye
with fire and freedom it becomes thee well
it is the bursting of a good seed sown
beneath a cold and artificial sky
it is genius overmastering its spell
when from my dreary home i first moved on
after my friend was in her grave clothes dressed
a dim despondence on my spirit pressed
as all my pleasant days were come and gone
strange whispers parted from the entombing clay
the thin air murmured each dumb object spake
bidding my overwhelmeacuted bosom ache
oft did i look to heaven but could not pray
how shall i leave thee quiet scene said i
how leave the passing breeze that loves to sweep
the holy sod where my due footsteps creep
the passing breeze it was she thy friend passed by
but the time came the passing breeze i left
farewell i sighed and seemed of all bereft
once we had joys in common common woes
have lately been our portion friend once loved
and still as much loved as mid sorrow's throes
it is possible to move or to be moved
faithless i'm not because no word that glows
no look that cheers accost a friend approved
love's language lies in more profound repose
than that of death since hope has been removed
from my soul's dreams
but couldst thou pierce my heart
and see the tenderest thought it doth enshrine
it is should myself and sorrow ever part
mine eyes shall then tell thee when sought by thine
while blessed tears gush like children's without art
these had not flowed wert thou again not mine
ah me dread friends of mine  love time and death
sweet love who came to me on sheeny wing
and gave her to my arms  her lips her breath
and all her golden ringlets clustering
and time who gathers in the flying years
he gave me all but where is all he gave
he took my love and left me barren tears
weary and lone i follow to the grave
there death will end this vision half divine
wan death who waits in shadow evermore
and silent ere he give the sudden sign
o gently lead me thro' thy narrow door
thou gentle death thou trustiest friend of mine
ah me for love   will death my love restore
in the black flower of midnight  at the heart
and midmost auricle of secrecy
there lies the golden fire seed that shall be
the day's broad blossom softly fall apart
the silken leaves of dreams and lo thou art
sweet morn of expectation dewy drest
while all the spectres that the dark infest
soon as the east doth his keen lances dart
show angel faces why avert the shade
the solemn vigil  the mysterious power
filling the soul with awe stirring the clod
bidding the bones to quake 'tis thus arrayed
in dusky calyx lies heaven's shining flower
our angel leads through gloom to show us god
sports of the field  deadly or maiming blow
aimed at a gentle bird  the timid hare
from her half slumber in warm brake to scare
and drive her over the track betraying snow
to death by chase embittered  from the bow
the rook not yet of strength to cleave the air
to slaughter trembling on the nest  to tear
the bowels of the fish deliberate slow
play with the agonizing worm  to find
amusement when the dauntless fox is torn
by furious dogs  or when the beauteous hind
winged by her unavailing fears is borne
from yells of hounds and horn  or the stag dies
with silent tear  thus man enjoys earth water skies
i love and day by day as absent pine
barr'd from her sight and converse whom i love
and yet the fair by plighted vows is mine
mine by affection far those vows above
mine by possession  o the bliss divine
nor can my heart her constancy reprove
why does she then society decline
with me me whose desires never from her remove
o night return and give her to my arms
full of constraint and tedious is the day
though the same roof enshrine her wedded charms
though on my board beam her benignant ray
o haste the hour when private and alone
joys only she can give shall be my own
dear mystic circlet orbs like thine are found
within their hallowd empire to enclose
such unimagin'd joys such cares and woes
as still in hearts most sensible abound
o since for me bliss animates thy mound
few be thy cares to her  and only those
whence sympathy more sweet and tender flows
and anguish with increas'd delight is crown'd
dear circlet  while with love and awe i gaze
on thy pure gold of constancy the sign
ah prompt if once imagination strays
recall my wedded thoughts to their blest shrine
nor look unkind nor passion's angry sound
e'er touch her gentle heart who bears from me thy round
just like love the balmy rose
for ah their sweets have many a thorn
and tempests chase their early morn
serenely calm each rarely glows
but when enchanting music flows
then pure and full delight is born
and anxious care and woe forlorn
are lull'd into divine repose
just like love blest music breathes
but with her bliss no pang enwreaths
like love ere death or fear or pain
invaded those primaeligval bowers
where the first parents hail'd the reign
of harmony mid angel powers
thou awful sea  upon this shingly beach
of aldborough i pace  my gazing eye
thy world of waters lost in the dim sky
admiring and thy echoing waves that teach
in voice of thunder more than tongue can preach
the knell of ages past and passing by
and claim their ancient empire o'er the dry
and solid earth each animating each
of towns long sunk o'er which thy wild waves roar
of sea to land of land to ocean turn'd
i muse and mourn that who could amplest pour
homeric tones on thy resounding shore
porson is dead  that sea of grecian lore
unbounded in the abyss of fate inurn'd
nature is music  and the mystic tale
no fable to the well attempered ear
which sings that harmony tunes every sphere
in perfect concert  though to mortals frail
too fine the spirit of the ethereal gale
to reach this seat of earthly hope and fear
when immortality removes the veil
then we shall see indeed and truly hear
thou wondrous visitant who hast so late
approacht the sun and now returning bright
in radiant glory from that source of light
in diapason voicest forth heaven's state
a chord thou art of that celestial lyre
to which through countless worlds resounds the angelic choir
thou who hast amply quaff'd the muse's rill
and bath'd thy locks in pure poetic dews
canst thou disparage the petrarcan muse
to her sweet voice deaf cold fastidious still
examine if unprejudic'd the will
coleridge which can to her high praise refuse
and of perverseness her fair laws accuse
which through the enchanted ear the bosom fill
her various cadenc'd regularity
he who o'er epic heights hath soar'd sublime
and magic spenser lov'd the mighty dead
have followers haply to posterity
not unendear'd  o scorn not these who led
in many a graceful maze the full harmonious rhyme
ye whose aspirings court the muse of lays
severest of those orders which belong
distinct and separate to delphic song
why shun the sonnet's undulating maze
or why its name boast of petrarcan days
assume its rules disown'd  whom from the throng
the muse selects their ear the charm obeys
of its full harmony  they fear to wrong
the sonnet by adorning with a name
of that distinguisht import lays though sweet
yet not in magic texture taught to meet
of that so varied and peculiar frame
o think to vindicate its genuine praise
those it becomes whose lyre a favoring impulse sways
half of my life is gone and i have let
the years slip from me and have not fulfilled
the asperations of my youth to build
some tower of song with lofty parapet
not indolence nor pleasure nor the fret
of restless passions that would not be stilled
but sorrow and a care that almost killed
kept me from what i may accomplish yet
though half way up the hill i see the past
lying beneath me with its sounds and sights
a city in the twilight dim and vast
with smoking roofs soft bells and gleaming lights
and hear above me on the autumnal blast
the cataract of death far thundering from the heights
in the long sleepless watches of the night
a gentle face  the face of one long dead
looks at me from the wall where round its head
the night lamp casts a halo of pale light
here in this room she died and soul more white
never through martyrdom of fire was led
to its repose nor can in books be read
the legend of a life more benedight
there is a mountain in the distant west
that sun defying in its deap ravines
displays a cross of snow upon its side
such is the cross i wear upon my breast
these eighteen years through all the changing scenes
and seasons changeless since the day she died
i pace the sounding sea beach and behold
how the voluminous billows roll and run
upheaving and subsiding while the sun
shines through their sheeted emerald far unrolled
and the ninth wave slow gathering fold by fold
all its loose flowing garments into one
plunges upon the shore and floods the dun
pale reach of sands and changes them to gold
so in majestic cadence rise and fall
the mighty undulations of thy song
o sightless bard england's maeonides
and ever and anon high over all
uplifted a ninth wave superb and strong
floods all the soul with its melodious seas
o ye dead poets who are living still
immortal in your verse though life be fled
and ye o living poets who are dead
though ye are living if neglect can kill
tell me if in the darkest hours of ill
with drops of anguish falling fast and red
from the sharp crown of thorns upon your head
ye were not glad your errand to fulfil
yes for the gift and ministry of song
have something in them so divinely sweet
it can assuage the bitterness of wrong
not in the clamor of the crowded street
not in the shouts and plaudits of the throng
but in ourselves are triumph and defeat
tuscan that wanderest through the realms of gloom
with thoughtful pace and sad majestic eyes
stern thoughts and awful from they thoughts arise
like farinata from his fiery tomb
thy sacred song is like the trump of doom
yet in thy heart what human sympathies
what soft compassion glows as in the skies
the tender stars their clouded lamps relume
methinks i see thee stand with pallid cheeks
by fra hilario in his diocese
as up the convent walls in golden streaks
the ascending sunbeams mark the day's decrease
and as he asks what there the stranger seeks
thy voice along the cloister whispers peace
i saw the long line of the vacant shore
the sea weed and the shells upon the sand
and the brown rocks left bare on every hand
as if the ebbing tide would flow no more
then heard i more distinctly than before
the ocean breathe and its great breast expand
and hurrying came on the defenseless land
the insurgent waters with tumultuous roar
all thought and feeling and desire i said
love laughter and the exultant joy of song
have ebbed from me for ever suddenly o'er me
they swept again from their deep ocean bed
and in a tumult of delight and strong
as youth and beautiful as youth upbore me
torrent of light and river of the air
along whose bed the glimmering stars are seen
like gold and silver sands in some ravine
where mountain streams have left their channels bare
the spaniard sees in thee the pathway where
his patron saint descended in the sheen
of his celestial armor on serene
and quiet nights when all the heavens were fair
not this i see nor yet the ancient fable
of phaeton's wild course that scorched the skies
wherever the hoofs of his hot coursers trod
but the white drift of worlds o'er chasms of sable
the star dust that is whirled aloft and flies
from the invisible chariot wheels of god
once upon iceland's solitary strand
a poet wandered with his book and pen
seeking some final word some sweet amen
wherewith to close the volume in his hand
the billows rolled and plunged upon the sand
the circling sea gulls swept beyond his ken
and from the parting cloud rack now and then
flashed the red sunset over sea and land
then by the billows at his feet was tossed
a broken oar and carved thereon he read
oft was i weary when i toiled at thee
and like a man who findeth what was lost
he wrote the words then lifted up his head
and flung his useless pen into the sea
sweet chimes that in the loneliness of night
salute the passing hour and in the dark
and silent chambers of the household mark
the movements of the myriad orbs of light
through my close eyelids by the inner sight
i see the constellations in the arc
of their great circles moving on and hark
i almost hear them singing in their flight
better than sleep it is to lie awake
o'ercanopied by the vast starry dome
of the immeasurable sky to feel
the slumbering world sink under us and make
hardly an eddy  a mere rush of foam
on the great sea beneath a sinking keel
the holiest of all holidays are those
kept by ourselves in silence and apart
the secret anniversaries of the heart
when the full river of feeling overflows
the happy days unclouded to their close
the sudden joys that out of darkness start
as flames from ashes swift desires that dart
like swallows singing down each wind that blows
white as the gleam of a receding sail
white as a cloud that floats and fades in air
white as the whitest lily on the stream
these tender memories are  a fairy tale
of some enchanted land we know not where
but lovely as a landscape in a dream
slowly the hour hand of the clock moves round
so slowly that no human eye hath power
to see it move slowly in shine or shower
the painted ship above it homeward bound
sails but seems motionless as if aground
yet both arrive at last and in his tower
the slumbrous watchman wakes and strikes the hour
a mellow measured melancholy sound
midnight the outpost of advancing day
the frontier town and citadel of night
the watershed of time from which the streams
of yesterday and to morrow take their way
one to the land of promise and of light
one to the land of darkness and of dreams
white swan of cities slumbering in thy nest
so wonderfully built among the reeds
of the lagoon that fences thee and feeds
as sayeth thy old historian and thy guest
white water lily cradled and caressed
by ocean streams and from the silt and weeds
lifting thy golden filaments and seeds
thy sun illumined spires thy crown and crest
white phantom city whose untrodden streets
are rivers and whose pavements are the shifting
shadows of palaces and strips of sky
i wait to see thee vanish like the fleets
seen in a mirage or towers of cloud uplifting
in air their unsubstantial masonry
the sea awoke at midnight from its sleep
and round the pebbly beaches far and wide
i heard the first wave of the rising tide
rush onward with uninterrupted sweep
a voice out of the silence of the deep
a sound mysteriously multiplied
as of a cataract from the mountain's side
or roar of winds upon a wooded steep
so comes to us at times from the unknown
and inaccessible solitudes of being
the rushing of the sea tides of the soul
and inspirations that we deem our own
are some divine foreshadowing and foreseeing
of things beyond our reason or control
as a fond mother when the day is o'er
leads by the hand her little child to bed
half willing half reluctant to be led
and leave his broken playthings on the floor
still gazing at them through the open door
nor wholly reassured and comforted
by promises of others in their stead
which though more splendid may not please him more
so nature deals with us and takes away
our playthings one by one and by the hand
leads us to rest so gently that we go
scarce knowing if we wished to go or stay
being too full of sleep to understand
how far the unknown transcends the what we know
thou comest autumn heralded by the rain
with banners by great gales incessant fanned
brighter than brightest silks of samarcand
and stately oxen harnessed to thy wain
thou standest like imperial charlemagne
upon thy bridge of gold thy royal hand
outstretched with benedictions o'er the land
blessing the farms through all thy vast domain
thy shield is the red harvest moon suspended
so long beneath the heaven's o'erhanging eaves
thy steps are by the farmer's prayers attended
like flames upon an altar shine the sheaves
and following thee in thy ovation splendid
thine almoner the wind scatters thy golden leaves
oft have i seen at some cathedral door
a laborer pausing in the dust and heat
lay down his burden and with reverent feet
enter and cross himself and on the floor
kneel to repeat his paternoster o'er
far off the noises of the world retreat
the loud vociferations of the street
become an undistinguishable roar
so as i enter here from day to day
and leave my burden at this minster gate
kneeling in prayer and not ashamed to pray
the tumult of the time disconsolate
to inarticulate murmurs dies away
while the eternal ages watch and wait
how strange the sculptures that adorn these towers
this crowd of statues in whose folded sleeves
birds build their nests while canopied with leaves
parvis and portal bloom like trellised bowers
and the vast minster seems a cross of flowers
but fiends and dragons on the gargoyled eaves
watch the dead christ between the living thieves
and underneath the traitor judas lowers
ah from what agonies of heart and brain
what exultations trampling on despair
what tenderness what tears what hate of wrong
what passionate outcry of a soul in pain
uprose this poem of the earth and air
this mediaeval miracle of song
i enter and i see thee in the gloom
of the long aisles o poet saturnine
and strive to make my steps keep pace with thine
the air is filled with some unknown perfume
the congregation of the dead make room
for thee to pass the votive tapers shine
like rooks that haunt ravenna's groves of pine
the hovering echoes fly from tomb to tomb
from the confessionals i hear arise
rehearsals of forgotten tragedies
and lamentations from the crypts below
and then a voice celestial that begins
with the pathetic words although your sins
as scarlet be and ends with as the snow
with snow white veil and garments as of flame
she stands before thee who so long ago
filled thy young heart with passion and the woe
from which thy song and all its splendors came
and while with stern rebuke she speaks thy name
the ice about thy heart melts as the snow
on mountain heights and in swift overflow
comes gushing from thy lips in sobs of shame
thou makest full confession and a gleam
as of the dawn on some dark forest cast
seems on thy lifted forehead to increase
lethe and eunoc  the remembered dream
and the forgotten sorrow  bring at last
that perfect pardon which is perfect peace
i lift mine eyes and all the windows blaze
with forms of saints and holy men who died
here martyred and hereafter glorffied
and the great rose upon its leaves displays
christ's triumph and the angelic roundelays
with splendor upon splendor multiplied
and beatrice again at dante's side
no more rebukes but smiles her words of praise
and then the organ sounds and unseen choirs
sing the old latin hymns of peace and love
and benedictions of the holy ghost
and the melodious bells among the spires
o'er all the house tops and through heaven above
proclaim the elevation of the host
o star of morning and of liberty
o bringer of the light whose splendor shines
above the darkness of the apennines
forerunner of the day that is to be
the voices of the city and the sea
the voices of the mountains and the pines
repeat thy song till the familiar lines
are footpaths for the thought of italy
thy flame is blown abroad from all the heights
through all the nations and a sound is heard
as of a mighty wind and men devout
strangers of rome and the new proselytes
in their own language hear thy wondrous word
and many are amazed and many doubt
the traveller tells how in that ancient clime
whose mystic monuments and ruins hoar
still struggle with the antiquary's lore
to guard the secrets of a by gone time
he saw uprising from the desert bare
like a white ghost a city of the dead
with palaces and temples wondrous fair
where moon horn'd isis once was worshipped
but silence like a pall did all enfold
and the inhabitants were turn'd to stone
yea stone the very heart of every one
once to a rich man i this tale re told
stone hearts  a traveller's myth    he turn'd aside
as hunger begg'd pale featured and wild eyed
the cloudy blackness gathers over the sky
shadowing these realms with that portentous storm
ere long to burst and haply to deform
fair nature's face for indignation high
might hurl promiscuous vengeance with wild hand
and fear with fierce precipitation throw
blind ruin wide while hate with scowling brow
feigns patriot rage
o priestley for thy wand
or franklin thine with calm expectant joy
to tame the storm and with mysterious force
in viewless channel shape the lightning's course
to purify creation not destroy
so should fair order from the tempest rise
and freedom's sun beams gild unclouded skies
though not the gaudy tulip's drap'ry fine
yet thou fair plant canst tyre's rich purple boast
the beauty of the amethyst is thine
thy neat and simple garb delights me most
unseen and shadowy forms of tiny size
delicious dew drops from thy surface sip
feast on thy charms their microscopic eyes
and breathe thy sweets as o'er thy leaves they trip
emblem of innocence and modest worth
who lov'st the eye of rude remark to shun
whose lovely lowly form still tends to earth
unlike the flower which courts the mid day sun
thou seem'st sweet flow'ret of his beam afraid
thus merit ever loves and seeks the shade
genius of tuneful verse inspired by whom
divine maeonides in numbers first
dawn'd on a world o'ercast with mental gloom
and strains sublime to barb'rous greece rehearsed
spirit of song from whose castilian fount
the mantuan poet sweet instruction drew
with piercing ken to whose aonian mount
once albion's bards on eagle pinions flew
though far aloof thy vot'ry stretch his wing
that o'er no classic land presumes to soar
him hast thou taught in plaintive strains to sing
to feel thy solace and thy power adore
and spite of envy's futile venom thou
hast placed a leaf of laurel on his brow
our love is not a fading earthly flower
its wingegraved seed dropped down from paradise
and nursed by day and night by sun and shower
doth momently to fresher beauty rise
to us the leafless autumn is not bare
nor winter's rattling boughs lack lusty green
our summer hearts make summer's fulness where
no leaf or bud or blossom may be seen
for nature's life in love's deep life doth lie
love  whose forgetfulness is beauty's death
whose mystic key these cells of thou and i
into the infinite freedom openeth
and makes the body's dark and narrow grate
the wide flung leaves of heaven's palace gate
i thought our love at full but i did err
joy's wreath drooped o'er mine eyes i could not see
that sorrow in our happy world must be
love's deepest spokesman and interpreter
but as a mother feels her child first stir
under her heart so felt i instantly
deep in my soul another bond to thee
thrill with that life we saw depart from her
o mother of our angel child twice dear
death knits as well as parts and still i wis
her tender radiance shall enfold us here
even as the light borne up by inward bliss
threads the void glooms of space without a fear
to print on farthest stars her pitying kiss
they pass me by like shadows crowds on crowds
dim ghosts of men that hover to and fro
hugging their bodies round them like thin shrouds
wherein their souls were buried long ago
they trampled on their youth and faith and love
they cast their hope of human kind away
with heaven's clear messages they madly strove
and conquered  and their spirits turned to clay
lo how they wander round the world their grave
whose ever gaping maw by such is fed
gibbering at living men and idly rave
we only truly live but ye are dead
alas poor fools the anointed eye may trace
a dead soul's epitaph in every face
the wisest man could ask no more of fate
than to be simple modest manly true
safe from the many honoured by the few
to count as naught in world or church or state
but inwardly in secret to be great
to feel mysterious nature ever new
to touch if not to grasp her endless clue
and learn by each discovery how to wait
he widened knowledge and escaped the praise
he wisely taught because more wise to learn
he toiled for science not to draw men's gaze
but for her lore of self denial stern
that such a man could spring from our decay
fans the soul's nobler faith until it burn
true as the sun's own work but more refined
it tells of love behind the artist's eye
of sweet companionships with earth and sky
and summers stored the sunshine of the mind
what peace sure ere you breathe the fickle wind
will break its truce and bend that grass plume high
scarcely yet quiet from the gilded fly
that flits a more luxurious perch to find
thanks for a pleasure that can never pall
a serene moment deftly caught and kept
to make immortal summer on my wall
had he who drew such gladness ever wept
ask rather could he else have seen at all
or grown in nature's mysteries an adept
as cleansed of tiber's and oblivion's slime
glow farnesina's vaults with shapes again
that dreamed some exiled artist from his pain
back to his athens and the muse's clime
so these world orphaned waifs of want and crime
purged by art's absolution from the stain
of the polluting city flood regain
ideal grace secure from taint of time
an attic frieze you give a pictured song
for as with words the poet paints for you
the happy pencil at its labour sings
stealing his privilege nor does him wrong
beneath the false discovering the true
and beauty's best in unregarded things
leisure thou goddess of a bygone age
when hours were long and days sufficed to hold
wide eyed delights and pleasures uncontrolled
by shortening moments when no gaunt presage
of undone duties modern heritage
haunted our happy minds must thou withhold
thy presence from this over busy world
and bearing silence with thee disengage
our twined fortunes  deeps of unhewn woods
alone can cherish thee alone possess
thy quiet teeming vigor  this our crime
not to have worshipped marred by alien moods
that sole condition of all loveliness
the dreaming lapse of slow unmeasured time
swept clean and still across the polished floor
from some unshuttered casement hid from sight
the level sunshine slants its greater light
quenching the little lamp which pallid poor
flickering unreplenished at the door
has striven against darkness the long night
dawn fills the room and penetrating bright
the silent sunbeams through the window pour
and she lies sleeping ignorant of fate
enmeshed in listless dreams her soul not yet
ripened to bear the purport of this day
the morning breeze scarce stirs the coverlet
a shadow falls across the sunlight wait
a lark is singing as he flies away
goaded and harassed in the factory
that tears our life up into bits of days
ticked off upon a clock which never stays
shredding our portion of eternity
we break away at last and steal the key
which hides a world empty of hours ways
of space unroll and heaven overlays
the leafy sun lit earth of fantasy
beyond the ilex shadow glares the sun
scorching against the blue flame of the sky
brown lily pads lie heavy and supine
within a granite basin under one
the bronze gold glimmer of a carp and i
reach out my hand and pluck a nectarine
cloud topped and splendid dominating all
the little lesser hills which compass thee
thou standest bright with april's buoyancy
yet holding winter in some shaded wall
of stern steep rock and startled by the call
of spring thy trees flush with expectancy
and cast a cloud of crimson silently
above thy snowy crevices where fall
pale shrivelled oak leaves while the snow beneath
melts at their phantom touch  another year
is quick with import  such each year has been
unmoved thou watchest all and all bequeath
some jewel to thy diadem of power
thou pledge of greater majesty unseen
a little garden on a bleak hillside
where deep the heavy dazzling mountain snow
lies far into the spring  the sun's pale glow
is scarcely able to melt patches wide
about the single rose bush  all denied
of nature's tender ministries  but no
for wonder working faith has made it blow
with flowers many hued and starry eyed
here sleeps the sun long idle summer hours
here butterflies and bees fare far to rove
amid the crumpled leaves of poppy flowers
here four o'clocks to the passionate night above
fling whiffs of perfume like pale incense showers
a little garden loved with a great love
thou yellow trumpeter of laggard spring
thou herald of rich summer's myriad flowers
the climbing sun with new recovered powers
does warm thee into being through the ring
of rich brown earth he woos thee makes thee fling
thy green shoots up inheriting the dowers
of bending sky and sudden sweeping showers
till ripe and blossoming thou art a thing
to make all nature glad thou art so gay
to fill the lonely with a joy untold
nodding at every gust of wind to day
to morrow jewelled with raindrops  always bold
to stand erect full in the dazzling play
of april's sun for thou hast caught his gold
always we are following a light
always the light recedes with groping hands
we stretch toward this glory while the lands
we journey through are hidden from our sight
dim and mysterious folded deep in night
we care not all our utmost need demands
is but the light the light  so still it stands
surely our own if we exert our might
fool  never can'st thou grasp this fleeting gleam
its glowing flame would die if it were caught
its value is that it doth always seem
but just a little farther on  distraught
but lighted ever onward we are brought
upon our way unknowing in a dream
a face seen passing in a crowded street
a voice heard singing music large and free
and from that moment life is changed and we
become of more heroic temper meet
to freely ask and give a man complete
radiant because of faith we dare to be
what nature meant us  brave idolatry
which can conceive a hero  no deceit
no knowledge taught by unrelenting years
can quench this fierce untamable desire
we know that what we long for once achieved
will cease to satisfy  be still our fears
if what we worship fail us still the fire
burns on and it is much to have believed
must all of worth be travailled for and those
life's brightest stars rise from a troubled sea
must years go by in sad uncertainty
leaving us doubting whose the conquering blows
are we or fate the victors  time which shows
all inner meanings will reveal but we
shall never know the upshot  ours to be
wasted with longing shattered in the throes
the agonies of splendid dreams which day
dims from our vision but each night brings back
we strive to hold their grandeur and essay
to be the thing we dream  sudden we lack
the flash of insight life grows drear and gray
and hour follows hour nerveless slack
life  austere arbiter of each man's fate
by whom he learns that nature's steadfast laws
are as decrees immutable o pause
your even forward march  not yet too late
teach me the needed lesson when to wait
inactive as a ship when no wind draws
to stretch the loosened cordage  one implores
thy clemency whose wilfulness innate
has gone uncurbed and roughshod while the years
have lengthened into decades now distressed
he knows no rule by which to move or stay
and teased with restlessness and desperate fears
he dares not watch in silence thy wise way
bringing about results none could have guessed
what instinct forces man to journey on
urged by a longing blind but dominant
nothing he sees can hold him nothing daunt
his never failing eagerness  the sun
setting in splendour every night has won
his vassalage those towers flamboyant
of airy cloudland palaces now haunt
his daylight wanderings  forever done
with simple joys and quiet happiness
he guards the vision of the sunset sky
though faint with weariness he must possess
some fragment of the sunset's majesty
he spurns life's human friendships to profess
life's loneliness of dreaming ecstasy
the wind is singing through the trees to night
a deep voiced song of rushing cadences
and crashing intervals  no summer breeze
is this though hot july is at its height
gone is her gentler music with delight
she listens to this booming like the seas
these elemental loud necessities
which call to her to answer their swift might
above the tossing trees shines down a star
quietly bright this wild tumultuous joy
quickens nor dims its splendour  and my mind
o star is filled with your white light from far
so suffer me this one night to enjoy
the freedom of the onward sweeping wind
the path runs straight between the flowering rows
a moonlit path hemmed in by beds of bloom
where phlox and marigolds dispute for room
with tall red dahlias and the briar rose
't is reckless prodigality which throws
into the night these wafts of rich perfume
which sweep across the garden like a plume
over the trees a single bright star glows
dear garden of my childhood here my years
have run away like little grains of sand
the moments of my life its hopes and fears
have all found utterance here where now i stand
my eyes ache with the weight of unshed tears
you are my home do you not understand
how is it that being gone you fill my days
and all the long nights are made glad by thee
no loneliness is this nor misery
but great content that these should be the ways
whereby the fancy dreaming as she strays
makes bright and present what she would would be
and who shall say if the reality
is not with dreams so pregnant  for delays
and hindrances may bar the wished for end
a thousand misconceptions may prevent
our souls from coming near enough to blend
let me but think we have the same intent
that each one needs to call the other friend
it may be vain illusion  i'm content
i ask but one thing of you only one
that always you will be my dream of you
that never shall i wake to find untrue
all this i have believed and rested on
forever vanished like a vision gone
out into the night  alas how few
there are who strike in us a chord we knew
existed but so seldom heard its tone
we tremble at the half forgotten sound
the world is full of rude awakenings
and heaven born castles shattered to the ground
yet still our human longing vainly clings
to a belief in beauty through all wrongs
o stay your hand and leave my heart its songs
what torture lurks within a single thought
when grown too constant and however kind
however welcome still the weary mind
aches with its presence  dull remembrance taught
remembers on unceasingly unsought
the old delight is with us but to find
that all recurring joy is pain refined
become a habit and we struggle caught
you lie upon my heart as on a nest
folded in peace for you can never know
how crushed i am with having you at rest
heavy upon my life  i love you so
you bind my freedom from its rightful quest
in mercy lift your drooping wings and go
i do not care to talk to you although
your speech evokes a thousand sympathies
and all my being's silent harmonies
wake trembling into music  when you go
it is as if some sudden dreadful blow
had severed all the strings with savage ease
no do not talk but let us rather seize
this intimate gift of silence which we know
others may guess your thoughts from what you say
as storms are guessed from clouds where darkness broods
to me the very essence of the day
reveals its inner purpose and its moods
as poplars feel the rain and then straightway
reverse their leaves and shimmer through the woods
my heart is tuned to sorrow and the strings
vibrate most readily to minor chords
searching and sad my mind is stuffed with words
which voice the passion and the ache of things
illusions beating with their baffled wings
against the walls of circumstance and hoards
of torn desires broken joys records
of all a bruised life's maimed imaginings
now you are come  you tremble like a star
poised where behind earth's rim the sun has set
your voice has sung across my heart but numb
and mute i have no tones to answer  far
within i kneel before you speechless yet
and life ablaze with beauty i am dumb
how empty seems the town now you are gone
a wilderness of sad streets where gaunt walls
hide nothing to desire sunshine falls
eery distorted as it long had shone
on white dead faces tombed in halls of stone
the whir of motors stricken through with calls
of playing boys floats up at intervals
but all these noises blur to one long moan
what quest is worth pursuing  and how strange
that other men still go accustomed ways
i hate their interest in the things they do
a spectre horde repeating without change
an old routine  alone i know the days
are still born and the world stopped lacking you
all night i wrestled with a memory
which knocked insurgent at the gates of thought
the crumbled wreck of years behind has wrought
its disillusion now i only cry
for peace for power to forget the lie
which hope too long has whispered  so i sought
the sleep which would not come and night was fraught
with old emotions weeping silently
i heard your voice again and knew the things
which you had promised proved an empty vaunt
i felt your clinging hands while night's broad wings
cherished our love in darkness  from the lawn
a sudden quivering birdnote like a taunt
my arms held nothing but the empty dawn
i learnt to write to you in happier days
and every letter was a piece i chipped
from off my heart a fragment newly clipped
from the mosaic of life its blues and grays
its throbbing reds i gave to earn your praise
to make a pavement for your feet i stripped
my soul for you to walk upon and slipped
beneath your steps to soften all your ways
but now my letters are like blossoms pale
we strew upon a grave with hopeless tears
i ask no recompense i shall not fail
although you do not heed the long sad years
still pass and still i scatter flowers frail
and whisper words of love which no one hears
throughout the echoing chambers of my brain
i hear your words in mournful cadence toll
like some slow passing bell which warns the soul
of sundering darkness  unrelenting fain
to batter down resistance fall again
stroke after stroke insistent diastole
the bitter blows of truth until the whole
is hammered into fact made strangely plain
where shall i look for comfort  not to you
our worlds are drawn apart our spirit's suns
divided and the light of mine burnt dim
now in the haunted twilight i must do
your will  i grasp the cup which over runs
and with my trembling lips i touch the rim
forever the impenetrable wall
of self confines my poor rebellious soul
i never see the towering white clouds roll
before a sturdy wind save through the small
barred window of my jail  i live a thrall
with all my outer life a clipped square hole
rectangular a fraction of a scroll
unwound and winding like a worsted ball
my thoughts are grown uneager and depressed
through being always mine my fancy's wings
are moulted and the feathers blown away
i weary for desires never guessed
for alien passions strange imaginings
to be some other person for a day
white glittering sunlight fills the market square
spotted and sprigged with shadows  double rows
of bartering booths spread out their tempting shows
of globed and golden fruit the morning air
smells sweet with ripeness on the pavement there
a wicker basket gapes and overflows
spilling out cool blue plums  the market glows
and flaunts and clatters in its busy care
a stately minster at the northern side
lifts its twin spires to the distant sky
pinnacled carved and buttressed through the wide
arched doorway peals an organ suddenly
crashing triumphant in its pregnant tide
quenching the square in vibrant harmony
he died of stranger's fever when his youth
had scarcely melted into manhood so
the chiselled legend runs a brother's woe
laid bare for epitaph  the savage ruth
of a sunny bright but alien land uncouth
with cruel caressing dealt a mortal blow
and by this summer sea where flowers grow
in tropic splendor witness to the truth
of ineradicable race he lies
the law of duty urged that he should roam
should sail from fog and chilly airs to skies
clear with deceitful welcome  he had come
with proud resolve but still his lonely eyes
ached with fatigue at never seeing home
poor foolish monarch vacillating vain
decaying victim of a race of kings
swift destiny shook out her purple wings
and caught him in their shadow not again
could furtive plotting smear another stain
across his tarnished honour  smoulderings
of sacrificial fires burst their rings
and blotted out in smoke his lost domain
bereft of courtiers only with his queen
from empty palace down to empty quay
no challenge screamed from hostile carabine
a single vessel waited shadowy
all night she ploughed her solitary way
beneath the stars and through a tranquil sea
great master  boyish sympathetic man
whose orbed and ripened genius lightly hung
from life's slim twisted tendril and there swung
in crimson sphered completeness guardian
of crystal portals through whose openings fan
the spiced winds which blew when earth was young
scattering wreaths of stars as jove once flung
a golden shower from heights cerulean
crumbled before thy majesty we bow
forget thy empurpled state thy panoply
of greatness and be merciful and near
a youth who trudged the highroad we tread now
singing the miles behind him so may we
faint throbbings of thy music overhear
the planted seed consigned to common earth
disdains to moulder with the baser clay
but rises up to meet the light of day
spreads all its leaves and flowers and tendrils forth
and bathed and ripened in the genial ray
pours out its perfume on the wandering gales
till in that fragrant breath its life exhales
so this immortal germ within my breast
would strive to pierce the dull dark clod of sense
with aspirations wingéd and intense
would so stretch upward in its tireless quest
to meet the central soul its source its rest
so in the fragrance of the immortal flower
high thoughts and noble deeds its life it would outpour
the enthusiast brooding in his cell apart
o'er the sad image of the crucified
the drooping head closed lips and piercéd side
a holy vision fills his raptured heart
with heavenly power inspired his unskilled arm
shapes the rude block to this transcendent form
oh son of god thus ever thus would i
dwell on the loveliness enshrined in thee
the lofty faith the sweet humility
the boundless love the love that could not die
and as the sculptor with thy glory warm
gave to this chiselled ivory thy fair form
so would my spirit in thy thought divine
grow to a semblance fair as this of thine
securely cabined in the ship below
through darkness and through storm i cross the sea
a pathless wilderness of waves to me
but yet i do not fear because i know
that he who guides the good ship o'er that waste
sees in the stars her shining pathway traced
blindfold i walk this life's bewildering maze
up flinty steep through frozen mountain pass
through thornset barren and through deep morass
but strong in faith i tread the uneven ways
and bare my head unshrinking to the blast
because my father's arm is round me cast
and if the way seems rough i only clasp
the hand that leads me with a firmer grasp
if the young mother clasp for the first time
the mortal child that earthly love has given
with a deep joy preluding that of heaven
who shall describe thy ecstacy sublime
oh virgin mother when upon thy ear
the message of the announcing angel fell
in heavenly tones to calm thy rising fear
and thy approaching glory to fortell
was ever mother so divinely blest
as when the glow of heaven yet clinging round him
before the weight of human grief had bound him
the gentle christ child to thy heart was prest
oh blessed among women joy like thine
what hand shall dare describe alas not mine
oh in that better land to which i go
say shall i know thee as i know thee here
and will thy presence dim that glorious sphere
as it hath darkened all the earth below
oh will that voice enchain my listening ear
whose frozen music stops my pulses now
and shall i meet in that fair land of bliss
those calm cold eyes that chill me so in this
shall i bear hence e'en memory of thee
unheeded then will pass the angel throngs
i shall not hear the seraph's burning songs
and heaven itself will be all dark to me
oh give me rather that drear hopeless faith
that sees no morn beyond the night of death
the honey bee that wanders all day long
the field the woodland and the garden o'er
to gather in his fragrant winter store
humming in calm content his quiet song
seeks not alone the rose's glowing breast
the lily's dainty cup the violet's lips
but from all rank and noxious weeds he sips
the single drop of sweetness closely press'd
within the poison chalice thus if we
seek only to draw forth the hidden sweet
in all the varied human flowers we meet
in the wide garden of humanity
and like the bee if home the spoil we bear
hived in our hearts it turns to nectar there
oh thou who once on earth beneath the weight
of our mortality didst live and move
the incarnation of profoundest love
who on the cross that love didst consummate
whose deep and ample fullness could embrace
the poorest meanest of our fallen race
how shall we e'er that boundless debt repay
by long loud prayers in gorgeous temples said
by rich oblations on thine altars laid
ah no not thus thou didst appoint the way
when thou wast bowed our human woe beneath
then as a legacy thou didst bequeath
earth's sorrowing children to our ministry
and as we do to them we do to thee
go forth in life oh friend not seeking love
a mendicant that with imploring eye
and outstretched hand asks of the passers by
the alms his strong necessities may move
for such poor love to pity near allied
thy generous spirit may not stoop and wait
a suppliant whose prayer may be denied
like a spurned beggar's at a palace gate
but thy heart's affluence lavish uncontrolled
the largess of thy love give full and free
as monarchs in their progress scatter gold
and be thy heart like the exhaustless sea
that must its wealth of cloud and dew bestow
though tributary streams or ebb or flow
as some dark stream within a cavern's breast
flows murmuring moaning for the distant sun
so ere i met thee murmuring its unrest
did my life's current coldly darkly run
and as that stream beneath the sun's full gaze
its separate course and life no more maintains
but now absorbed transfused far o'er the plains
it floats etherealized in those warm rays
so in the sunlight of thy fervid love
my heart so long to earth's dark channels given
now soars all pain all doubt all ill above
and breathes the ether of the upper heaven
so thy high spirit holds and governs mine
so is my life my being lost in thine
ah no my love knows no vain jealousy
the rose that blooms and lives but in the sun
asks not what other flowers he shines upon
if he but shine on her enough for me
thus in thy light to dwell and thus to share
the sunshine of thy smile with all things fair
i know thou'rt vowed to beauty not to love
i would not stay thy footsteps from one shrine
nor would i bind thee by a sigh to mine
for me  i have no lingering wish to rove
for though i worship all things fair like thee
of outward grace of soul nobility
happier than thou i find them all in one
and i would worship at thy shrine alone
the mountain lake o'ershadowed by the hills
may still gaze heavenward on the evening star
whose distant light its dark recesses fills
though boundless distance must divide them far
still may the lake the star's bright image bear
still may the star from its blue ether dome
shower down its silver beams across the gloom
and light the wave that wanders darkly there
star of my life thus do i turn to thee
amid the shadows that above me roll
thus from thy distant sphere thou shinest on me
thus does thine image float upon my soul
through the wide space that must our lives dissever
far as the lake and star ah me forever
night closes round me and wild threatening forms
clasp me with icy arms and chain me down
and bind upon my brow a cypress crown
dewy with tears and heaven frowns dark with storms
but the one glorious memory of thee
rises upon my path to guide and bless
the bright shekinah of the wilderness
the polar star upon a trackless sea
the beaming pharos of the unreached shore
it spans the clouds that gather o'er my way
the rainbow of my life's tempestuous day
oh blessed thought stay with me evermore
and shed thy lustrous beams where midnight glooms
as fragrant lamps burned in the ancient tombs
give me the bracelets that your warriors wear
the roman traitress to the sabine cried
give me the toys and i will be your guide
and to your host the city's gates unbar
then to the walls each eager warrior rushed
and on the base tarpeia as he passed
each from his arm the massive circlet cast
till her slight form beneath the weight was crushed
thus are our idle wishes thus we sigh
for some imagined good yet unattained
for wealth or fame or love and which once gained
may like a curse o'er all our future lie
thus in our blindness do we ask of fate
the gifts that once bestowed may crush us with their weight
oh bard what though upon thy mortal eyes
there fell no glimmering ray of earthly light
and the deep shadow of eternal night
shut from thy gaze our lovely earth and skies
yet was it to thy spirit's vision given
to gaze upon the splendors of that shore
eye had not seen nor heart conceived before
then didst thou poet laureate of heaven
sing of those courts and of that angel host
of that majestic spirit who in vain
dared warred and fell never to rise again
and of that paradise so early lost
in strains posterity shall not let die
in thoughts that wander through eternity
thou brave old titan that in chains didst lie
bound to the rock on the caucasian hill
who by sublime endurance didst defy
imperial jove and all his shapes of ill
as i invoke thy spirit here to day
from the old pagan world thou speak'st to me
i hear thy voice across time's sounding sea
bid me thus bear and conquer  i obey
henceforth like thee i will endure and wait
on life's bleak summit bound without dismay
then in thine iron car roll on thy way
thou stern relentless power that men call fate
loose then thy bolts thou dark and threat'ning sky
thou vulture at my heart feed to satiety
soon as the azure colored gates of th' east
were set wide open by the watchful morn
i walked abroad as having took no rest
for nights are tedious to a man forlorn
and viewing well each pearl bedeweacuted flower
then waxing dry by splendor of the sun
all scarlet hued i saw him 'gin to lour
and blush as though some heinous act were done
at this amazed i hied me home amain
thinking that i his anger causeacuted had
and at his set abroad i walked again
when lo the moon looked wondrous pale and sad
anger the one and envy moved the other
to see my love more fair than love's fair mother
what sugared terms what all persuading art
what sweet mellifluous words what wounding looks
love used for his admittance to my heart
such eloquence was never read in books
he promised pleasure rest and endless joy
fruition of the fairest she alive
his pleasure pain rest trouble joy annoy
have i since found which me of bliss deprive
the trojan horse thus have i now let in
wherein enclosed these armeacuted men were placed
bright eyes fair cheeks sweet lips and milk white skin
these foes my life have overthrown and razed
fair outward shows prove inwardly the worst
love looketh fair but lovers are accurst
weary with serving where i nought could get
i thought to cross great neptune's greatest seas
to live in exile but my drift was let
by cruel fortune spiteful of such ease
the ship i had to pass in was my mind
greedy desire was topsail of the same
my tears were surges sighs did serve for wind
of all my ship despair was chiefest frame
sorrow was master care the cable rope
grief was the mainmast love the captain of it
he that did rule the helm was foolish hope
but beauty was the rock that my ship split
which since bath made such shipwreck of my joy
that still i swim in th' ocean of annoy
end this enchantment love of my desires
let me no longer languish for thy love
joy not to see me thus consume in fires
but let my cruel pains thy hard heart move
and now at last with pitiful regard
eye me thy lover lorn for lack of thee
which dying lives in hope of sweet reward
which hate hath hitherto withheld from me
constant have i been still in fancy fast
ordained by heavens to dote upon thy fair
nor will i e'er so long as life shall last
say any's fairer breathing vital air
but when the ocean sands shall lie unwet
then shall my soul to love thee dear forget
if love should count you worthy and should deign
one day to seek your door and be your guest
pause ere you draw the bolt and bid him rest
if in your old content you would remain
for not alone he enters in his train
are angels of the mists the lonely quest
dreams of the unfulfilled and unpossessed
and sorrow and life's immemorial pain
he wakes desires you never may forget
he shows you stars you never saw before
he makes you share with him for evermore
the burden of the world's divine regret
how wise were you to open not  and yet
how poor if you should turn him from the door
the shadows lengthen of the elm and lime
while night with her dark cloak enfolds the land
and lights the watch fires where her sentinels stand
waiting for dawn hushed is the forge of time
whereon men fashion noble deed and crime
for nature's pulse beats thro' the empty strand
and heavy scented lane as hand in hand
with leaden footed night she threads the dark sublime
then from the seventh gate's ivory portal hies
grim death's twin sister sleep with slumbrous crown
of drooping poppies dipped in lethe's stream
and here a kiss and here a rosy dream
bestows on mortals soothing tired eyes
with gracious gifts that pain and sorrow drown
the soft blue touch of turquoise crystal clear
curves o'er white hills and rivers' frozen flow
draped in a virgin robe of dazzling snow
that veils the silent landscape far and near
swathing the withered herbage brown and sere
and the tall dusky pines that  sweeping low
their long dark branches  violet shadows throw
across the stainless marble of the mere
hark through the stillness break the glad sleigh bells
in silvery cadence through the frosty air
of happy hearts their merry music tells
of glad home comings  meetings everywhere
but late we owned the sway of christmas spells
now new year chimes ring out the call to prayer
there is a splendid tropic flower which flings
its fiery disc wide open to the core
one pulse of subtlest fragrance  once a life
that rounds a century of blossoming things
and dies a flower's apotheosis nevermore
to send up in the sunshine in sweet strife
with all the winds a fountain of life flame
a winged censer in the starlight swung
once only flinging all its wealth abroad
to the wide deserts without shore or name
and dying like a lovely song once sung
by some dead poet music's wandering ghost
aeligons ago blown out of life and lost
remembered only in the heart of god
hail land of drifting cloud and wooded mold
thy fairy scenes seem conjured by the hand
of wizard king thy hills majestic stand
aloft with time bronzed brows seareacuted and old
and heavenward fling their nodding peaks on high
the breezy zephyrs rush careering free
the eagle waves his wing of liberty
here nature reigns in grand sublimity
far through the southern haze old ocean gleams
silvered with sunlight foam and mounfully
heaves his wild arms  with words inspired he seems
mutt'ring a prologue to eternity
god of my soul on earth such scenes we find
guiding from them to thee the human mind
wailing diminutive of me be still
or cry but spare me that regretful tone
of sorrows elemental waxing shrill
o you of living things the most alone
son do you thus reproach me and make moan
because upon love's chariot i did fly
and a horn winded in the great unknown
calling your atoms out to be an i
should i have let you in abeyance lie
disintegrate another million years
then use your life to teach you how to die
and pass again beyond the reach of tears
some day you may regret i dragged you thence
perhaps forgive the vast impertinence
i from whose heart young love is long time gone
beyond recall  and in his secret place
dull sorrow soothes with sad averted face
her restless sister pain with visage wan
handmaidens of the shadow footed one
who comes more slowly than the season's pace
creeping around the year  i wish you grace
as you stand glorious in life's morning sun
your blood red lips are eager at the brim
of that deep cup now amply poured for you
drink with closed eyes nor look upon the lees
they only quaff whose joys are memories
drink of the bubbles sparkling at the rim
the dregs are bitter and your hours are few
o love if those clear faithful eyes of thine
were ever turned away there then should be
no heav'nly looks to take the gloom from mine
nor any hills nor any dales for me
nor any honeyed cups of eglantine
nor morning spilth of dew on land or sea
no sun should rise and leave his eastern tent
to wake the music of the rambling wave
nor any freshness of the west be seen
to sweep away night's savours of the grave
but when i gaze into those fadeless eyes
methinks i am in some mysterious land
where far off seas take colour from the skies
and voiceless on a mountain top i stand
blithe fancy lightly builds with airy hands
or on the edges of the darkness peers
breathless and frightened at the voice she hears
imagination lo the sky expands
travels the blue arch and cimmerian sands
homeless on earth the pilgrim of the spheres
the rush of light before the hurrying years
the voice that cries in unfamiliar lands
men weigh the moons that flood with eerie light
the dusky vales of saturn  wood and stream
but who shall follow on the awful sweep
of neptune through the dim and dreadful deep
onward he wanders in the unknown night
and we are shadows moving in a dream
the strongest singer of these latter days
has left the turmoil of earth's busy throng
but his rich voice is with us and his song
gladdens our hearts and on our darkest ways
throws gleam of living light his steady praise
of truth and right his lesson firm and strong
our lives are not our own that they belong
to god  is here to comfort and to raise
then while we weep for him our laurelled king
our hearts can truly say he is not dead
nay more he sleeps not but with undimmed mind
still works among us still abides to bring
balm to the bleeding hearts whence hope has fled
strength to the weak light to the groping blind
it must have been for one of us my own
to drink this cup and eat this bitter bread
had not my tears upon thy face been shed
thy tears had dropped on mine if i alone
did not walk now thy spirit would have known
my loneliness and did my feet not tread
this weary path and steep thy feet had bled
for mine and thy mouth had for mine made moan
and so it comforts me yea not in vain
to think of thine eternity of sleep
to know thine eyes are tearless though mine weep
and when this cup's last bitterness i drain
one thought shall still its primal sweetness keep
thou hadst the peace and i the undying pain
is this the sky and this the very earth
i had such pleasure in when i was young
and can this be the identical sea song
heard once within the storm cloud's awful girth
when a great cloud from silence burst to birth
and winds to whom it seemed i did belong
made the keen blood in me run swift and strong
with irresistible tempestuous mirth
are these the forests loved of old so well
where on may nights enchanted music was
are these the fields of soft delicious grass
these the old hills with secret things to tell
o my dead youth was this inevitable
that with thy passing nature too should pass
here  where last night she came even she for whom
i would so gladly live or lie down dead
came in the likeness of a dream and said
some words that thrilled this desolate ghost thronged room
i sit alone now in the absolute gloom
ah surely on her breast was leaned my head
ah surely on my mouth her kiss was shed
while all my life broke into scent and bloom
give thanks heart for thy rootless flower of bliss
nor think the gods severe though thus they seem
though thou hast much to bear and much to miss
whilst thou thy nights and days to be canst deem
one thing and that thing veritably this
the imperishable memory of a dream
a child with mystic eyes and flowing hair
i saw her first 'mid flowers that shared her grace
though but a boy i cried how fair a face
and coming nearer told her she was fair
she faintly smiled yet did not say forbear
but seemed to take a pleasure in my praise
she led my steps through many a leafy place
and pointed where shy birds and sweet flowers were
at length we stood upon a brooklet's brink
i seem to hear its sources babbling yet
she gave me water from her hand to drink
the while her eyes upon its flow were set
thy name i asked she whispered low regret
then faded as the sun began to sink
we met again as i foresaw we should
youth flooded all my veins and she had grown
to woman's height yet seemed a rose half blown
like sunset clouds that o'er a landscape brood
her eyes were that they might not be withstood
and like the wind's voice when it takes the tone
of pine trees was her voice i cried my own
and kneeling there i worshipped her and wooed
o bitter marriage though inevitable
ordained by fate who wrecks or saves our days
lo the changed bride no longer fair of face
and in her eyes the very fires of hell
thy name i cried and these words hissing fell
anguish  and madness comes of my embrace
what thing may be to come i cannot know
her eyes have less of hell in them meanwhile
at times she almost smiles a ghastly smile
i have in all things done her bidding so
chill are the rooms wherein no bright fires glow
where no fair picture does the eye beguile
once awful laughter shook the gloomy pile
unholy riotous shapes went to and fro
there is no sound now in the house at all
only outside the wind moans on alway
my lady sorrow has no word to say
seems half content for well she knows her thrall
shall not escape from her that should god call
she would rise with him at the judgment day
in that tranced hush when sound sank awed to rest
ere from her spirit's rose red rose sweet gate
came forth to me her royal word of fate
did she sigh yes and droop upon my breast
while round our rapture dumb fixed unexpressed
by the seized senses there did fluctuate
the plaintive surges of our mortal state
tempering the poignant ecstasy too blest
do i wake into a dream or have we twain
lured by soft wiles to some unconscious crime
dared joys forbid to man oh light supreme
upon our brows transfiguring glory rain
nor let the sword of thy just angel gleam
on two who entered heaven before their time
if i had lived ere seer or priest unveiled
a life to come methinks that knowing thee
i should have guessed thine immortality
for nature giving instincts never failed
to give the ends they point to never quailed
the swallow through air wilds o'er tracts of sea
to chase the summer seeds that prisoned be
dream of and find the daylight unassailed
by doubt impelled by yearnings for the main
the creature river born doth there emerge
so thou with thoughts and longings which our earth
can never compass in its narrow verge
shalt the fit region of thy spirit gain
and death fulfil the promptings of thy birth
dost thou do well dear idol of my heart
to thrall me in the meshes of thy charms
to fill my constant soul with soft alarms
then coyly thrust me from thy love apart
pluck from my breast i pluck the mystic dart
yield  or i perish  to these folding arms
assuage the hunger of this sick desire
that wraps me like an aromatic fire
oh lull with thy ambrosial breath the swarms
of wounded thoughts that issue from my brain
and seek thy presence seek thee day and night
and on thy brow and eyes and lips alight
extracting aye a honey that is pain
oh save me with thy kisses or kill me quite
not sweeter to the storm tossed mariner
is glimpse of home where wife and children wait
to welcome him with kisses at the gate
than to the town worn man the breezy stir
of mountain winds on rugged pathless heights
his long pent soul drinks in the deep delights
that nature hath in store  the sun kissed bay
gleams thro' the grand old gnarled gum tree boughs
like burnished brass the strong winged bird of prey
sweeps by upon his lonely vengeful way
while over all like breath of holy vows
the sweet airs blow and the high vaulted sky
looks down in pity this fair summer day
on all poor earth born creatures doomed to die
a plaintive sonnet flowed from milton's pen
when time had stolen his three and twentieth year
say shall not i then shed one tuneful tear
robbed by the thief of three score years and ten
no for the foes of all life lengthened men
trouble and toil approach not yet too near
reason meanwhile and health and memory dear
hold unimpaired their weak yet wonted reign
still round my sheltered lawn i pleased can stray
still trace my sylvan blessings to their spring
being of beings yes that silent lay
which musing gratitude delights to sing
still to thy sapphire throne shall faith convey
and hope the cherub of unwearied wing
the tarnished coin preserves its heart of gold
nor loses worth through honourable use
thou little book mayst plead no light excuse
for these soiled covers when thy tale is told
drear mountains hast thou known and rested cold
in sterile vales where no soft airs induce
the stream night frozen his trampled bed to sluice
of countless struggling hoofs the silent mould
there where a hundred camp fires dying glow
pale midst the smoke that rises to the stars
and tumult falls asleep beloved of mars
thou hast unlocked for me thy heart of woe
or joy for me alone  no thought of wars
of weary marches of the untiring foe
man's no mere scribe who in the cloistered gloom
of some old convent sits away his life
who at his trencher finds his only strife
the rest fat peace  as in his narrow room
he writes till blinded by time's darkening rheum
an image rather find in one who leaving wife
and child and friends proclaims war to the knife
with luxury and seeks his unknown doom
among the mountains where the ages lie
buried 'neath miles of monumental stone
region of distance height immensity
writes with his heart's blood in those spaces lone
his last sad message there where eagles cry
they find his bones far still the highest cone
mother of soldiers once there was a time
when your sons' swords won fame in many a clime
when europe press'd on france they fought alone
for her and served her better than their own
those were the days your exiles made their fame
by gallant deeds which put our age to shame
those were the days cremona city saved
stood to attest what irish valor braved
when england's chivalry sore wounded fled
before the stormy charge o'brien led
when travellers saw in ypres' coir display'd
the trophies of your song renown'd brigade
mother of soldiers france was proud to see
your shamrock then twined with the fleur de lis
mother of soldiers in the cause of spain
the moors in oran's trench by them were slain
for full an hundred years their fatal steel
has charged beside the lances of castile
carb'ry's tyrconnell's breffny's exiled lords
to spain and glory gave their gallant swords
and spain of honor jealous gave them place
before her native sons in glory's race
her noblest laurels graced your soldiers' head
her dearest daughters shared your soldiers' bed
in danger's hour she call'd them to the front
and gave to them the praise who bore the brunt
mother of soldiers spain to day will be
a willing witness for thy sons and thee
mother of soldiers on the volga's banks
your practised leaders form'd the russian ranks
and fallen limerick gave the chiefs to lead
the hosts who triumph'd o'er the famous swede
that time even austria gave them host on host
the ruling baton and the perilous post
buda belgrade prague deva  every trust
that man could earn and found them bold as just
velettri zorndorff dantzic still can tell
how austria's irish soldiers fought and fell
and how the ruling skill that led them on
to conquer was supplied by your own son
mother of soldiers while these trophies last
you're safe against the sland'rers of the past
mother of exiles from your soil to day
new myriads are destroy'd or swept away
the crowded graveyards grow no longer green
the daily dead have scanty space i ween
the groaning ships freighted with want and grief
entomb in every wave a fugitive
the sword no more an irish weapon is
the spirit of the land no longer lives
mother 'twas kill'd before the famine came
the stubble was prepared to meet the flame
all manly souls were from their bodies torn
and what avails it if the bodies burn
mother of soldiers may we hope to be
yet fit to strike for vengeance and for thee
not of the mighty not of the world's friends
have i aspired to speak within these leaves
these best befit their joyful kindred pens
my path lies where a broken people grieves
by the ohio on the yuba's banks
as night displays her standard to their eyes
alone in tears or gather'd in sad ranks
stirring the brooding air with woful sighs
i see them sit i hear their mingled speech
gaelic or saxon but all from the heart
home is the word that sways the soul of each
a word beyond the embellishments of art
yet of this theme i feebly seek to sing
and to my banish'd kin a book of home i bring
i have a sea going spirit haunts my sleep
not a sad spirit wearisome to follow
less like a tenant of the mystic deep
than the good fairy of the hazel hollow
full often at the midwatch of the night
i see departing in his silver bark
this spirit steering toward an eastern light
calling me to him from the western dark
spirit i ask say whither bound away
unto the old hesperides he cries
oh spirit take me in thy bark i pray
for thee i came  he joyfully replies
exile no longer shalt thou absent mourn
for i the spirit am men call  return
although she feeds me bread of bitterness
and sinks into my throat her tiger's tooth
stealing my breath of life i will confess
i love this cultured hell that tests my youth
her vigor flows like tides into my blood
giving me strength erect against her hate
her bigness sweeps my being like a flood
yet as a rebel fronts a king in state
i stand within her walls with not a shred
of terror malice not a word of jeer
darkly i gaze into the days ahead
and see her might and granite wonders there
beneath the touch of time's unerring hand
like priceless treasures sinking in the sand
aleta mentions in her tender letters
among a chain of quaint and touching things
that you are feeble weighted down with fetters
and given to strange deeds and mutterings
no longer without trace or thought of fear
do you leap to and ride the rebel roan
but have become the victim of grim care
with three brown beauties to support alone
but none the less will you be in my mind
wild may that cantered by the risky ways
with showy head cloth flirting in the wind
from market in the glad december days
wild may of whom even other girls could rave
before sex tamed your spirit made you slave
i would be wandering in distant fields
where man and bird and beast lives leisurely
and the old earth is kind and ever yields
her goodly gifts to all her children free
where life is fairer lighter less demanding
and boys and girls have time and space for play
before they come to years of understanding
somewhere i would be singing far away
for life is greater than the thousand wars
men wage for it in their insatiate lust
and will remain like the eternal stars
when all that shines to day is drift and dust
but i am bound with you in your mean graves
o black men simple slaves of ruthless slaves
oh when i think of my long suffering race
for weary centuries despised oppressed
enslaved and lynched denied a human place
in the great life line of the christian west
and in the black land disinherited
robbed in the ancient country of its birth
my heart grows sick with hate becomes as lead
for this my race that has no home on earth
then from the dark depths of my soul i cry
to the avenging angel to consume
the white man's world of wonders utterly
let it be swallowed up in earth's vast womb
or upward roll as sacrificial smoke
to liberate my people from its yoke
i shall return again i shall return
to laugh and love and watch with wonder eyes
at golden noon the forest fires burn
wafting their blue black smoke to sapphire skies
i shall return to loiter by the streams
that bathe the brown blades of the bending grasses
and realize once more my thousand dreams
of waters rushing down the mountain passes
i shall return to hear the fiddle and fife
of village dances dear delicious tunes
that stir the hidden depths of native life
stray melodies of dim remembered runes
i shall return i shall return again
to ease my mind of long long years of pain
reg wished me to go with him to the field
i paused because i did not want to go
but in her quiet way she made me yield
reluctantly for she was breathing low
her hand she slowly lifted from her lap
and smiling sadly in the old sweet way
she pointed to the nail where hung my cap
her eyes said i shall last another day
but scarcely had we reached the distant place
when o'er the hills we heard a faint bell ringing
a boy came running up with frightened face
we knew the fatal news that he was bringing
i heard him listlessly without a moan
although the only one i loved was gone
the dawn departs the morning is begun
the trades come whispering from off the seas
the fields of corn are golden in the sun
the dark brown tassels fluttering in the breeze
the bell is sounding and the children pass
frog leaping skipping shouting laughing shrill
down the red road over the pasture grass
up to the school house crumbling on the hill
the older folk are at their peaceful toil
some pulling up the weeds some plucking corn
and others breaking up the sun baked soil
float faintly scented breeze at early morn
over the earth where mortals sow and reap
beneath its breast my mother lies asleep
the sun sought thy dim bed and brought forth light
the sciences were sucklings at thy breast
when all the world was young in pregnant night
thy slaves toiled at thy monumental best
thou ancient treasure land thou modern prize
new peoples marvel at thy pyramids
the years roll on thy sphinx of riddle eyes
watches the mad world with immobile lids
the hebrews humbled them at pharaoh's name
cradle of power yet all things were in vain
honor and glory arrogance and fame
they went the darkness swallowed thee again
thou art the harlot now thy time is done
of all the mighty nations of the sun
here passing lonely down this quiet lane
before a mud splashed window long i pause
to gaze and gaze while through my active brain
still thoughts are stirred to wakefulness because
long long ago in a dim unknown land
a massive forest tree ax felled adze hewn
was deftly done by cunning mortal hand
into a symbol of the tender moon
why does it thrill more than the handsome boat
that bore me o'er the wild atlantic ways
and fill me with rare sense of things remote
from this harsh land of fretful nights and days
i cannot answer but whate'er it be
an old wine has intoxicated me
stay season of calm love and soulful snows
there is a subtle sweetness in the sun
the ripples on the stream's breast gaily run
the wind more boisterously by me blows
and each succeeding day now longer grows
the birds a gladder music have begun
the squirrel full of mischief and of fun
from maples' topmost branch the brown twig throws
i read these pregnant signs know what they mean
i know that thou art making ready to go
oh stay i fled a land where fields are green
always and palms wave gently to and fro
and winds are balmy blue brooks ever sheen
to ease my heart of its impassioned woe
roar of the rushing train fearfully rocking
impatient people jammed in line for food
the rasping noise of cars together knocking
and worried waiters some in ugly mood
crowding into the choking pantry hole
to call out dishes for each angry glutton
exasperated grown beyond control
from waiting for his soup or fish or mutton
at last the station's reached the engine stops
for bags and wraps the red caps circle round
from off the step the passenger lightly hops
and seeks his cab or tram car homeward bound
the waiters pass out weary listless glum
to spend their tips on harlots cards and rum
applauding youths laughed with young prostitutes
and watched her perfect half clothed body sway
her voice was like the sound of blended flutes
blown by black players upon a picnic day
she sang and danced on gracefully and calm
the light gauze hanging loose about her form
to me she seemed a proudly swaying palm
grown lovelier for passing through a storm
upon her swarthy neck black shiny curls
luxuriant fell and tossing coins in praise
the wine flushed bold eyed boys and even the girls
devoured her shape with eager passionate gaze
but looking at her falsely smiling face
i knew her self was not in that strange place
the dawn the dawn the crimson tinted comes
out of the low still skies over the hills
manhattan's roofs and spires and cheerless domes
the dawn my spirit to its spirit thrills
almost the mighty city is asleep
no pushing crowd no tramping tramping feet
but here and there a few cars groaning creep
along above and underneath the street
bearing their strangely ghostly burdens by
the women and the men of garish nights
their eyes wine weakened and their clothes awry
grotesques beneath the strong electric lights
the shadows wane the dawn comes to new york
and i go darkly rebel to my work
o whisper o my soul the afternoon
is waning into evening whisper soft
peace o my rebel heart for soon the moon
from out its misty veil will swing aloft
be patient weary body soon the night
will wrap thee gently in her sable sheet
and with a leaden sigh thou wilt invite
to rest thy tired hands and aching feet
the wretched day was theirs the night is mine
come tender sleep and fold me to thy breast
but what steals out the gray clouds like red wine
o dawn o dreaded dawn o let me rest
weary my veins my brain my life have pity
no once again the harsh the ugly city
for the dim regions whence my fathers came
my spirit bondaged by the body longs
words felt but never heard my lips would frame
my soul would sing forgotten jungle songs
i would go back to darkness and to peace
but the great western world holds me in fee
and i may never hope for full release
while to its alien gods i bend my knee
something in me is lost forever lost
some vital thing has gone out of my heart
and i must walk the way of life a ghost
among the sons of earth a thing apart
for i was born far from my native clime
under the white man's menace out of time
i plucked my soul out of its secret place
and held it to the mirror of my eye
to see it like a star against the sky
a twitching body quivering in space
a spark of passion shining on my face
and i explored it to determine why
this awful key to my infinity
conspires to rob me of sweet joy and grace
and if the sign may not be fully read
if i can comprehend but not control
i need not gloom my days with futile dread
because i see a part and not the whole
contemplating the strange i'm comforted
by this narcotic thought i know my soul
their shadow dims the sunshine of our day
as they go lumbering across the sky
squawking in joy of feeling safe on high
beating their heavy wings of owlish gray
they scare the singing birds of earth away
as greed impelled they circle threateningly
watching the toilers with malignant eye
from their exclusive haven  birds of prey
they swoop down for the spoil in certain might
and fasten in our bleeding flesh their claws
they beat us to surrender weak with fright
and tugging and tearing without let or pause
they flap their hideous wings in grim delight
and stuff our gory hearts into their maws
the vivid grass with visible delight
springing triumphant from the pregnant earth
the butterflies and sparrows in brief flight
chirping and dancing for the season's birth
the dandelions and rare daffodils
that touch the deep stirred heart with hands of gold
the thrushes sending forth their joyous trills
not these not these did i at first behold
but seated on the benches daubed with green
the castaways of life a few asleep
some withered women desolate and mean
and over all life's shadows dark and deep
moaning i turned away for misery
i have the strength to bear but not to see
his spirit in smoke ascended to high heaven
his father by the cruelest way of pain
had bidden him to his bosom once again
the awful sin remained still unforgiven
all night a bright and solitary star
perchance the one that ever guided him
yet gave him up at last to fate's wild whim
hung pitifully o'er the swinging char
day dawned and soon the mixed crowds came to view
the ghastly body swaying in the sun
the women thronged to look but never a one
showed sorrow in her eyes of steely blue
and little lads lynchers that were to be
danced round the dreadful thing in fiendish glee
into the furnace let me go alone
stay you without in terror of the heat
i will go naked in  for thus 'tis sweet
into the weird depths of the hottest zone
i will not quiver in the frailest bone
you will not note a flicker of defeat
my heart shall tremble not its fate to meet
my mouth give utterance to any moan
the yawning oven spits forth fiery spears
red aspish tongues shout wordlessly my name
desire destroys consumes my mortal fears
transforming me into a shape of flame
i will come out back to your world of tears
a stronger soul within a finer frame
if we must die let it not be like hogs
hunted and penned in an inglorious spot
while round us bark the mad and hungry dogs
making their mock at our accursed lot
if we must die o let us nobly die
so that our precious blood may not be shed
in vain then even the monsters we defy
shall be constrained to honor us though dead
o kinsmen we must meet the common foe
though far outnumbered let us show us brave
and for their thousand blows deal one death blow
what though before us lies the open grave
like men we'll face the murderous cowardly pack
pressed to the wall dying but fighting back
no engines shrieking rescue storm the night
and hose and hydrant cannot here avail
the flames laugh high and fling their challenging light
and clouds turn gray and black from silver pale
the fire leaps out and licks the ancient walls
and the big building bends and twists and groans
a bar drops from its place a rafter falls
burning the flowers the wind in frenzy moans
the watchers gaze held wondering by the fire
the dwellers cry their sorrow to the crowd
the flames beyond themselves rise higher higher
to lose their glory in the frowning cloud
yielding at length the last reluctant breath
and where life lay asleep broods darkly death
sometimes i tremble like a storm swept flower
and seek to hide my tortured soul from thee
bowing my head in deep humility
before the silent thunder of thy power
sometimes i flee before thy blazing light
as from the specter of pursuing death
intimidated lest thy mighty breath
windways will sweep me into utter night
for oh i fear they will be swallowed up
the loves which are to me of vital worth
my passion and my pleasure in the earth
and lost forever in thy magic cup
i fear i fear my truly human heart
will perish on the altar stone of art
throughout the afternoon i watched them there
snow fairies falling falling from the sky
whirling fantastic in the misty air
contending fierce for space supremacy
and they flew down a mightier force at night
as though in heaven there was revolt and riot
and they frail things had taken panic flight
down to the calm earth seeking peace and quiet
i went to bed and rose at early dawn
to see them huddled together in a heap
each merged into the other upon the lawn
worn out by the sharp struggle fast asleep
the sun shone brightly on them half the day
by night they stealthily had stol'n away
and suddenly my thoughts then turned to you
who came to me upon a winter's night
when snow sprites round my attic window flew
your hair disheveled eyes aglow with light
my heart was like the weather when you came
the wanton winds were blowing loud and long
but you with joy and passion all aflame
you danced and sang a lilting summer song
i made room for you in my little bed
took covers from the closet fresh and warm
a downful pillow for your scented head
and lay down with you resting in my arm
you went with dawn you left me ere the day
the lonely actor of a dreamy play
about soho we went before the light
we went unresting six craving new fun
new scenes new raptures for the fevered night
of rollicking laughter drink and song was done
the vault was void but for the dawn's great star
that shed upon our path its silver flame
when la paloma on a low guitar
abruptly from a darkened casement came
harlem all else shut out i saw the hall
and you in your red shoulder sash come dancing
with val against me languid by the wall
your burning coffee colored eyes keen glancing
aslant at mine proud in your golden glory
i loved you cuban girl fond sweet diory
not once in all our days of poignant love
did i a single instant give to thee
my undivided being wholly free
not all thy potent passion could remove
the barrier that loomed between to prove
the full supreme surrendering of me
oh i was beaten helpless utterly
against the shadow fact with which i strove
for when a cruel power forced me to face
the truth which poisoned our illicit wine
that even i was faithless to my race
bleeding beneath the iron hand of thine
our union seemed a monstrous thing and base
i was an outcast from thy world and mine
adventure seasoned and storm buffeted
i shun all signs of anchorage because
the zest of life exceeds the bound of laws
new gales of tropic fury round my head
break lashing me through hours of soulful dread
but when the terror thins and spent withdraws
leaving me wondering awhile i pause
but soon again the risky ways i tread
no rigid road for me no peace no rest
while molten elements run through my blood
and beauty burning bodies manifest
their warm heart melting motions to be wooed
and passion boldly rising in my breast
like rivers of the spring lets loose its flood
my spirit wails for water water now
my tongue is aching dry my throat is hot
for water fresh rain shaken from a bough
or dawn dews heavy in some leafy spot
my hungry body's burning for a swim
in sunlit water where the air is cool
as in trout valley where upon a limb
the golden finch sings sweetly to the pool
oh water water when the night is done
when day steals gray white through the windowpane
clear silver water when i wake alone
all impotent of parts of fevered brain
pure water from a forest fountain first
to wash me cleanse me and to quench my thirst
oh i have tried to laugh the pain away
let new flames brush my love springs like a feather
but the old fever seizes me to day
as sickness grips a soul in wretched weather
i have given up myself to every urge
with not a care of precious powers spent
have bared my body to the strangest scourge
to soothe and deaden my heart's unhealing rent
but you have torn a nerve out of my frame
a gut that no physician can replace
and reft my life of happiness and aim
oh what new purpose shall i now embrace
what substance hold what lovely form pursue
when my thought burns through everything to you
all night through the eternity of night
pain was my potion though i could not feel
deep in my humbled heart you ground your heel
till i was reft of even my inner light
till reason from my mind had taken flight
and all my world went whirling in a reel
and all my swarthy strength turned cold like steel
a passive mass beneath your puny might
last night i gave you triumph over me
so i should be myself as once before
i marveled at your shallow mystery
and haunted hungrily your temple door
i gave you sum and substance to be free
oh you shall never triumph any more
i do not fear to face the fact and say
how darkly dull my living hours have grown
my wounded heart sinks heavier than stone
because i loved you longer than a day
i do not shame to turn myself away
from beckoning flowers beautifully blown
to mourn your vivid memory alone
in mountain fastnesses austerely gray
the mists will shroud me on the utter height
the salty brimming waters of my breast
will mingle with the fresh dews of the night
to bathe my spirit hankering to rest
but after sleep i'll wake with greater might
once more to venture on the eternal quest
how fair her meadows stretch from sea to sea
with fruitful promise changing robes of green
varying ever till the golden sheen
of autumnal marks a glad maturity
how gay 'mid orchard boughs the russets be
the uplands crowned with crimson maples lean
long cooling arms of shadow while between
in sun or shade the flocks roam far and free
from east to west the harvest is her own
on either hand the ocean at her feet
her cool lakes' sweetest waters throb and beat
loke cool firm pulses of her temperate zone
gracious and just she calls from sea to sea
no room for malice none for bigotry
by this he knew she wept with waking eyes
that at his hand's light quiver by her head
the strange low sobs that shook their common bed
were called into her with a sharp surprise
and strangled mute like little gaping snakes
dreadfully venomous to him she lay
stone still and the long darkness flowed away
with muffled pulses then as midnight makes
her giant heart of memory and tears
drink the pale drug of silence and so beat
sleep's heavy measure they from head to feet
were moveless looking through their dead black years
by vain regret scrawled over the blank wall
like sculptured effigies they might be seen
upon their marriage tomb the sword between
each wishing for the sword that severs all
in our old shipwrecked days there was an hour
when in the firelight steadily aglow
joined slackly we beheld the red chasm grow
among the clicking coals our library bower
that eve was left to us and hushed we sat
as lovers to whom time is whispering
from sudden opened doors we heard them sing
the nodding elders mixed good wine with chat
well knew we that life's greatest treasure lay
with us and of it was our talk ah yes
love dies i said i never thought it less
she yearned to me that sentence to unsay
then when the fire domed blackening i found
her cheek was salt against my kiss and swift
up the sharp scale of sobs her breast did lift
now am i haunted by that taste that sound
on a starred night prince lucifer uprose
tired of his dark dominion swung the fiend
above the rolling ball in cloud part screened
where sinners hugged their spectre of repose
poor prey to his hot fit of pride were those
and now upon his western wing he leaned
now his huge bulk o'er afric's sands careened
now the black planet shadowed arctic snows
soaring through wider zones that pricked his scars
with memory of the old revolt from awe
he reached a middle height and at the stars
which are the brain of heaven he looked and sank
around the ancient track marched rank on rank
the army of unalterable law
at last we parley we so strangely dumb
in such a close communion it befell
about the sounding of the matin bell
and lo her place was vacant and the hum
of loneliness was round me then i rose
and my disordered brain did guide my foot
to that old wood where our first love salute
was interchanged the source of many throes
there did i see her not alone i moved
toward her and made proffer of my arm
she took it simply with no rude alarm
and that disturbing shadow passed reproved
i felt the pained speech coming and declared
my firm belief in her ere she could speak
a ghastly morning came into her cheek
while with a widening soul on me she stared
we saw the swallows gathering in the sky
and in the osier isle we heard them noise
we had not to look back on summer joys
or forward to a summer of bright dye
but in the largeness of the evening earth
our spirits grew as we went side by side
the hour became her husband and my bride
love that had robbed us so thus blessed our dearth
the pilgrims of the year waxed very loud
in multitudinous chatterings as the flood
full brown came from the west and like pale blood
expanded to the upper crimson cloud
love that had robbed us of immortal things
this little moment mercifully gave
where i have seen across the twilight wave
the swan sail with her young beneath her wings
i must not think of thee and tired yet strong
i shun the thought that lurks in all delight
the thought of thee  and in the blue heaven's height
and in the sweetest passage of a song
oh just beyond the fairest thoughts that throng
this breast the thought of thee waits hidden yet bright
but it must never never come in sight
i must stop short of thee the whole day long
but when sleep comes to close each difficult day
when night gives pause to the long watch i keep
and all my bonds i needs must loose apart
must doff my will as raiment laid away
with the first dream that comes with the first sleep
i run i run i am gathered to thy heart
a poet of one mood in all my lays
ranging all life to sing one only love
like a west wind across the world i move
sweeping my harp of floods mine own wild ways
the countries change but not the westwind days
which are my songs my soft skies shine above
and on all seas the colors of a dove
and on all fields a flash of silver greys
i make the whole world answer to my art
and sweet monotonous meanings in your ears
i change not ever bearing for my part
one thought that is the treasure of my years
a small cloud full of rain upon my heart
and in mine arms clasped like a child in tears
it has been said of many they were quite
prepared to prove i do not mean in fun
that white was really black and black was white
but i believe it has not yet been done
black saxon blac in any way to liken
with candour may seem almost out of reach
yet whiten is in kindred german bleichen
undoubtedly identical with bleach
this last verb's cognate adjective is bleak
reverting to the saxon bleak is blaeligk
a semivowel is at the last squeak
all that remains such difference wide to make
the hostile terms of keen antithesis
brought to an e plus ultra all but kiss
spirit of mine that soon must venturous spread
through voids unknown thy feeble fluttering plumes
hast thou no fear to wing those endless glooms
no apprehension nor misgivings dread
those realms unfathomed of the speechless dead
which never gleam of eldest star illumes
lethean canyons that the soul entombs
art thou not awed such sombre vasts to tread
my soul replied wisdom hath made all things
life and the end of life he gives to thee
down death's worn path the mightiest still have trod
where laurelled poets and anointed kings
have gone for ages it is good to be
rest thou contented with the will of god
upon a cloud among the stars we stood
the angel raised his hand and looked and said
which world of all yon starry myriad
shall we make wing to the still solitude
became a harp whereon his voice and mood
made spheral music round his haloed head
i spoke  for then i had not long been dead
let me look round upon the wastes and brood
a moment on these orbs ere i decide
what is yon lower star that beauteous shines
and with soft splendor now incarnadines
our wings  there would i go and there abide
then he as one who some child's thought divines
that is that world where yesternight you died
sole lord of lords and very king of kings
he sits within the desert carved in stone
inscrutable colossal and alone
and ancienter than memory of things
graved on his front the sacred beetle clings
disdain sits on his lips and in a frown
scorn lives upon his forehead for a crown
the affrighted ostrich dares not dust her wings
anear this presence the long caravan's
dazed camels pause and mute the bedouins stare
this symbol of past power more than man's
presages doom kings look  and kings despair
the sceptres tremble in their jeweled hands
and dark thrones totter in the baleful air
dear love lean nearer  let your finger tips
reach till they touch the rose within my palm
through the hushed dusk i feel the fragrant balm
of your faint breathing as the tired breast dips
and rises drowsful as a bee that sips
honey too avid from the numbing flowers
close the sad eyes and for one little hour
let slumber soothe the dear leave taking lips
ah sweet were it not better for each heart
before the cruel years achieve their will
for us who must irrevocably part
to pass the lintel of the door of death
lip touching lip i breathing faintly still
the poignant sweetness of your fading breath
the evening comes the boatman lifts the net
poles his canoe and leaves it on the shore
so low the stream he does not use the oar
the umber rocks rise like a parapet
up through the purple and the violet
and the faint heard and never ending roar
of moving waters lessens more and more
while each vague object looms a silhouette
the light is going but low overhead
poises the glory of the evening star
the fisher silent on the rocky bar
drops a still line in pools of fading red
and in the sky where all the day lies dead
slowly the golden crescent sinks afar
thou art not lovelier than lilacs  no
nor honeysuckle thou art not more fair
than small white single poppies  i can bear
thy beauty though i bend before thee though
from left to right not knowing where to go
i turn my troubled eyes nor here nor there
find any refuge from thee yet i swear
so has it been with mist  with moonlight so
like him who day by day unto his draught
of delicate poison adds him one drop more
till he may drink unharmed the death of ten
even so inured to beauty who have quaffed
each hour more deeply than the hour before
i drink  and live  what has destroyed some men
time does not bring relief you all have lied
who told me time would ease me of my pain
i miss him in the weeping of the rain
i want him at the shrinking of the tide
the old snows melt from every mountain side
and last year's leaves are smoke in every lane
but last year's bitter loving must remain
heaped on my heart and my old thoughts abide
there are a hundred places where i fear
to go  so with his memory they brim
and entering with relief some quiet place
where never fell his foot or shone his face
i say there is no memory of him here
and so stand stricken so remembering him
mindful of you the sodden earth in spring
and all the flowers that in the springtime grow
and dusty roads and thistles and the slow
rising of the round moon all throats that sing
the summer through and each departing wing
and all the nests that the bared branches show
and all winds that in any weather blow
and all the storms that the four seasons bring
you go no more on your exultant feet
up paths that only mist and morning knew
or watch the wind or listen to the beat
of a bird's wings too high in air to view
but you were something more than young and sweet
and fair  and the long year remembers you
not in this chamber only at my birth
when the long hours of that mysterious night
were over and the morning was in sight
i cried but in strange places steppe and firth
i have not seen through alien grief and mirth
and never shall one room contain me quite
who in so many rooms first saw the light
child of all mothers native of the earth
so is no warmth for me at any fire
to day when the world's fire has burned so low
i kneel spending my breath in vain desire
at that cold hearth which one time roared so strong
and straighten back in weariness and long
to gather up my little gods and go
if i should learn in some quite casual way
that you were gone not to return again
read from the back page of a paper say
held by a neighbor in a subway train
how at the corner of this avenue
and such a street so are the papers filled
a hurrying man  who happened to be you
at noon to day had happened to be killed
i should not cry aloud  i could not cry
aloud or wring my hands in such a place
i should but watch the station lights rush by
with a more careful interest on my face
or raise my eyes and read with greater care
where to store furs and how to treat the hair
this door you might not open and you did
so enter now and see for what slight thing
you are betrayed     here is no treasure hid
no cauldron no clear crystal mirroring
the sought for truth no heads of women slain
for greed like yours no writhings of distress
but only what you see     look yet again
an empty room cobwebbed and comfortless
yet this alone out of my life i kept
unto myself lest any know me quite
and you did so profane me when you crept
unto the threshold of this room to night
that i must never more behold your face
this now is yours  i seek another place
i shall forget you presently my dear
so make the most of this your little day
your little month your little half a year
ere i forget or die or move away
and we are done forever by and by
i shall forget you as i said but now
if you entreat me with your loveliest lie
i will protest you with my favorite vow
i would indeed that love were longer lived
and vows were not so brittle as they are
but so it is and nature has contrived
to struggle on without a break thus far
whether or not we find what we are seeking
is idle biologically speaking
loving you less than life a little less
than bitter sweet upon a broken wall
or bush wood smoke in autumn i confess
i cannot swear i love you not at all
for there is that about you in this light
a yellow darkness sinister of rain
which sturdily recalls my stubborn sight
to dwell on you and dwell on you again
and i am made aware of many a week
i shall consume remembering in what way
your brown hair grows about your brow and cheek
and what divine absurdities you say
till all the world and i and surely you
will know i love you whether or not i do
into the golden vessel of great song
let us pour all our passion breast to breast
let other lovers lie in love and rest
not we  articulate so but with the tongue
of all the world the churning blood the long
shuddering quiet the desperate hot palms pressed
sharply together upon the escaping guest
the common soul unguarded and grown strong
longing alone is singer to the lute
let still on nettles in the open sigh
the minstrel that in slumber is as mute
as any man and love be far and high
that else forsakes the topmost branch a fruit
found on the ground by every passer by
how healthily their feet upon the floor
strike down these are no spirits but a band
of children surely leaping hand in hand
into the air in groups of three and four
wearing their silken rags as if they wore
leaves only and light grasses or a strand
of black elusive seaweed oozing sand
and running hard as if along a shore
i know how lost forever and at length
how still these lovely tossing limbs shall lie
and the bright laughter and the panting breath
and yet before such beauty and such strength
once more as always when the dance is high
i am rebuked that i believe in death
love is not blind i see with single eye
your ugliness and other women's grace
i know the imperfection of your face
the eyes too wide apart the brow too high
for beauty learned from earliest youth am i
in loveliness and cannot so erase
its letters from my mind that i may trace
you faultless i must love until i die
more subtle is the sovereignty of love
so am i caught that when i say not fair
'tis but as if i said not here  not there
not risen  not writing letters well i know
what is this beauty men are babbling of
i wonder only why they prize it so
not with libations but with shouts and laughter
we drenched the altars of love's sacred grove
shaking to earth green fruits impatient after
the launching of the coloured moths of love
love's proper myrtle and his mother's zone
we bound about our irreligious brows
and fettered him with garlands of our own
and spread a banquet in his frugal house
not yet the god has spoken but i fear
though we should break our bodies in his flame
and pour our blood upon his altar here
henceforward is a grove without a name
a pasture to the shaggy goats of pan
whence flee forever a woman and a man
the light comes back with columbine she brings
a touch of this a little touch of that
coloured confetti and a favour hat
patches and powder dolls that work by strings
and moons that work by switches all the things
that please a sick man's fancy and a flat
spry convalescent kiss and a small pat
upon the pillow paper offerings
the light goes out with her the shadows sprawl
where she has left her fragrance like a shawl
i lie alone and pluck the counterpane
or on a dizzy elbow rise and hark
and down like dominoes along the dark
her little silly laughter spills again
oh think not i am faithful to a vow
faithless am i save to love's self alone
were you not lovely i would leave you now
after the feet of beauty fly my own
were you not still my hunger's rarest food
and water ever to my wildest thirst
i would desert you  think not but i would
and seek another as i sought you first
but you are mobile as the veering air
and all your charms more changeful than the tide
wherefore to be inconstant is no care
i have but to continue at your side
so wanton light and false my love are you
i am most faithless when i most am true
i do but ask that you be always fair
that i forever may continue kind
knowing me what i am you should not dare
to lapse from beauty ever nor seek to bind
my alterable mood with lesser cords
weeping and such soft matters must invite
to further vagrancy and bitter words
chafe soon to irremediable flight
wherefore i pray you if you love me dearly
less dear to hold me than your own bright charms
whence it may fall that until death or nearly
i shall not move to struggle from your arms
fade if you must  i would but bid you be
like the sweet year doing all things graciously
i pray you if you love me bear my joy
a little while or let me weep your tears
i too have seen the quavering fate destroy
your destiny's bright spinning  the dull sheares
meeting not neatly chewing at the thread
nor can you well be less aware how fine
how staunch as wire and how unwarranted
endures the golden fortune that is mine
i pray you for this day at least my dear
fare by my side that journey in the sun
else must i turn me from the blossoming year
and walk in grief the way that you have gone
let us go forth together to the spring
love must be this if it be anything
i think i should have loved you presently
and given in earnest words i flung in jest
and lifted honest eyes for you to see
and caught your hand against my cheek and breast
and all my pretty follies flung aside
that won you to me and beneath your gaze
naked of reticence and shorn of pride
spread like a chart my little wicked ways
i that had been to you had you remained
but one more waking frorn a recurrent dream
cherish no less the certain stakes i gained
and walk your memory's halls austere supreme
a ghost in marble of a girl you knew
who would have loved you in a day or two
when i too long have looked upon your face
wherein for me a brightness unobscured
save by the mists of brightness has its place
and terrible beauty not to be endured
i turn away reluctant from your light
and stand irresolute a mind undone
a silly dazzled thing deprived of a sight
from having looked too long upon the sun
then is my daily life a narrow room
in which a little while uncertainly
surrounded by impenetrable gloom
among familiar things grown strange to me
making my way i pause and feel and hark
till i become accustomed to the dark
and you as well must die belovegraved dust
and all your beauty stand you in no stead
this flawless vital hand this perfect head
this body of flame and steel before the gust
of death or under his autumnal frost
shall be as any leaf be no less dead
than the first leaf that fell this wonder fled
altered estranged disintegrated lost
nor shall my love avail you in your hour
in spite of all my love you will arise
upon that day and wander down the air
obscurely as the unattended flower
it mattering not how beautiful you were
or how belovegraveed above all else that dies
i only know that every hour with you
is torture to me and that i would be
from your two piognant lovelinesses free
rainbows green fire white diamonds the fierce blue
of shimmering ice bergs or to be shot through
with lightning or a sword incessantly
such things have beauty doubtless but to me
mist shadow silence  these are lovely too
there is no shelter in you anywhere
rhythmic intolerable your burning rays
trample upon me withering my breath
i will be gone and rid of you i swear
to stand upon the peaks of love always
proves but that part of love whose name is death
still will i harvest beauty where it grows
in coloured fungus and the spotted fog
surprised on foods forgotten in ditch and bog
filmed brilliant with irregular rainbows
of rust and oil where half a city throws
its empty tins and in some spongy log
whence headlong leaps the oozy emerald frog
and a black pupil in the green scum shows
her the inhabiter of divers places
surmising at all doors i push them all
oh you that fearful of a creaking hinge
turn back forevermore with craven faces
i tell you beauty bears an ultrafringe
unguessed of you upon her gossamer shawl
sometimes when i am wearied suddenly
of all the things that are the outward you
and my gaze wanders ere your tale is through
to webs of my own weaving or i see
abstractedly your hands about your knee
and wonder why i love you as i do
then i recall yet sorrow thus he drew
then i consider pride thus painted he
oh friend forget not when you fain would note
in me a beauty that was never mine
how first you knew me in a book i wrote
how first you loved me for a written line
so are we bound till broken is the throat
of song and art no more leads out the nine
euclid alone has looked on beauty bare
let all who prate of beauty hold their peace
and lay them prone upon the earth and cease
to ponder on themselves the while they stare
at nothing intricately drawn nowhere
in shapes of shifting lineage let geese
gabble and hiss but heroes seek release
from dusty bondage into luminous air
o blinding hour o holy terrible day
when first the shaft into his vision shone
of light anatomized euclid alone
has looked on beauty bare fortunate they
who though once only and then but far away
have heard her massive sandal set on stone
only until this cigarette is ended
a little moment at the end of all
while on the floor the quiet ashes fall
and in the firelight to a lance extended
bizarrely with the jazzing music blended
the broken shadow dances on the wall
i will permit my memory to recall
the vision of you by all my dreams attended
and then adieu  farewell  the dream is done
yours is a face of which i can forget
the colour and the features every one
the words not ever and the smiles not yet
but in your day this moment is the sun
upon a hill after the sun has set
i shall go back again to the bleak shore
and build a little shanty on the sand
in such a way that the extremest band
of brittle seaweed will escape my door
but by a yard or two and nevermore
shall i return to take you by the hand
i shall be gone to what i understand
and happier than i ever was before
the love that stood a moment in your eyes
the words that lay a moment on your tongue
are one with all that in a moment dies
a little under said and over sung
but i shall find the sullen rocks and skies
unchanged from what they were when i was young
cherish you then the hope i shall forget
at length my lord pieria  put away
for your so passing sake this mouth of clay
these mortal bones against my body set
for all the puny fever and frail sweat
of human love  renounce for these i say
the singing mountain's memory and betray
the silent lyre that hangs upon me yet
ah but indeed some day shall you awake
rather from dreams of me that at your side
so many nights a lover and a bride
but stern in my soul's chastity have lain
to walk the world forever for my sake
and in each chamber find me gone again
what is the lesson i have brought away
after the moment's palpitating glee
what has this pomp of men this strong array
of thousands and ten thousands been to me
did i find nothing but the vision gay
the mere phenomenon that all could see
did i feel nothing but the brute display
of power  the show of centred energy
trembling and humbled i was taught how hard
it is for our strait minds at once to scan
the might of banded numbers and regard
the individual soul the living man
to use mechanic multitudes and yet
our common human feelings not forget
what good were it to dim the pleasure glow
that lights thy cheek fair girl in scenes like these
by shameful facts and piteous histories
while we enjoy what matters what we know
what tender love sick looks on us below
those mountains cast how courteously the trees
raise up their branching heads in chalices
for the thick vine to fill and overflow
this nature is like thee all bright all mild
if then some self wise man should say that here
hate sin and death held rule for many a year
that of this kindliest earth there's not a rood
but has been saturate with brother's blood
believe him not believe him not my child
in just accordance with attentive sight
through airy space and round our planet ball
the inorganic world is voiced with light
and colours are the words it speaks withal
thus has my eye had glad experience
of that most perfect utterance and clear tone
with which all visible things address the sense
in lands retiring from the northern zone
but oh in what poor language faintly caught
do the old features of my england greet
her stranger son  how powerless how unmeet
for the free vision italy had taught
what to expect from nature i must scan
her face i fear no more and look alone to man
thee i would think one of the many wise
who in eliza's time sat eminent
to our now world as purgatory sent
to teach us what true english poets prize
pasquillant froth and foreign galliardize
are none of thine but when of gay intent
thou usest staid old english merriment
mannerly mirth which no one dare despise
the scoffs and girds of our poor critic rout
must move thy pity as amidst their mime
monk of truth's order from thy memories
thou dost updraw sublime simplicities
grand thoughts that never can be wearied out
showing the unreality of time
i have a debt of my heart's own to thee
school of my soul old lime and cloister shade
which i strange creditor should grieve to see
fully acquitted and exactly paid
the first ripe taste of manhood's best delights
knowledge imbibed while mind and heart agree
in sweet belated talk on winter nights
with friends whom growing time keeps dear to me
such things i owe thee and not only these
i owe thee the far beaconing memories
of the young dead who having crossed the tide
of life where it was narrow deep and clear
now cast their brightness from the further side
on the dark flowing hours i breast in fear
poet and artist think and care not whether
things hold in truth the glory that they show
beauty and beauteous thoughts will go together
while to one scene a thousand memories flow
long spirit strains from one wild note shall grow
magnificent tempests from one cloudy feather
from one bright ray the sunset's perfect glow
hymettian thyme beds from one plant of heather
into one scene a thousand memories flow
held we but this reflection at our hearts
and beauty never past without regard
no place would lack illuminated parts
and inward grace with outer mingle so
that nature should be never dark or hard
how soon hath time the subtle thief of youth
stolen on his wing my three and twentieth year
my hasting days fly on with full career
but my late spring no bud or blossom shew'th
perhaps my semblance might deceive the truth
that i to manhood am arrived so near
and inward ripeness doth much less appear
that some more timely happy spirits indu'th
yet be it less or more or soon or slow
it shall be still in strictest measure even
to that same lot however mean or high
toward which time leads me and the will of heaven
all is if i have grace to use it so
as ever in my great task master's eye
when i consider how my light is spent
ere half my days in this dark world and wide
and that one talent which is death to hide
lodged with me useless though my soul more bent
to serve therewith my maker and present
my true account lest he returning chide
doth god exact day labour light denied
i fondly ask but patience to prevent
that murmur soon replies god doth not need
either man's work or his own gifts who best
bear his mild yoke they serve him best his state
is kingly thousands at his bidding speed
and post o'er land and ocean without rest
they also serve who only stand and wait
avenge o lord thy slaughtered saints whose bones
lie scattered on the alpine mountains cold
even them who kept thy truth so pure of old
when all our fathers worshiped stocks and stones
forget not in thy book record their groans
who were thy sheep and in their ancient fold
slain by the bloody piemontese that rolled
mother with infant down the rocks their moans
the vales redoubled to the hills and they
to heaven their martyred blood and ashes sow
o'er all the italian fields where still doth sway
the triple tyrant that from these may grow
a hundredfold who having learnt thy way
early may fly the babylonian woe
methought i saw my late espoused saint
brought to me like alcestis from the grave
whom jove's great son to her glad husband gave
rescued from death by force though pale and faint
mine as whom washed from spot of childbed taint
purification in the old law did save
and such as yet once more i trust to have
full sight of her in heaven without restraint
came vested all in white pure as her mind
her face was veiled yet to my fancied sight
love sweetness goodness in her person shined
so clear as in no face with more delight
but oh as to embrace me she inclined
i waked she fled and day brought back my night
cromwell our chief of men who through a cloud
not of war only but detractions rude
guided by faith and matchless fortitude
to peace and truth thy glorious way hast ploughed
and on the neck of crowned fortune proud
hast reared god's trophies and his work pursued
while darwen stream with blood of scots imbrued
and dunbar field resounds thy praises loud
and worcester's laureate wreath yet much remains
to conquer still peace hath her victories
no less renowned than war new foes arise
threatening to bind our souls with secular chains
help us to save free conscience from the paw
of hireling wolves whose gospel is their maw
a book was writ of late called tetrachordon
and wov'n close both matter form and style
the subject new it walked the town awhile
numb'ring good intellects now seldom pored on
cries the stall reader 'bless us what a word on
a ttle page is this' and some in file
stand spelling false while one might walk to mile
end green why is it harder sirs than gordon
colkitto or macdonnel or galasp
those rugged names to our like mouths grow sleek
that would have made quintilian stare and gasp
thy age like ours o soul of sir john cheek
hated not learning worse than toad or asp
when thou taught'st cambridge and king edward greek
when faith and love which parted from thee never
had ripened thy just soul to dwell with god
meekly thou didst resign this earthly load
of death called life which us from life doth sever
thy works and alms and all thy good endeavour
stayed not behind nor in the grave were trod
but as faith pointed with her golden rod
followed thee up to joy and bliss for ever
love led them on and faith who knew them best
thy handmaids clad them o'er with purple beams
and azure wings that up they flew so drest
and spake the truth of thee on glorious themes
before the judge who thenceforth bid thee rest
and drink thy fill of pure immortal streams
cyriack whose grandsire on the royal bench
of british themis with no mean applause
pronounced and in his volumes taught our laws
which others at their bar so often wrench
to day deep thoughts resolve with me to drenchdt
in mirth that after no repenting draws
let euclid rest and archimedes pause
and what the swede intend and what the french
to measure life learn thou betimes and know
toward solid good what leads the nearest way
for other things mild heaven a time ordains
and disapproves that care though wise in show
that with superfluous burden loads the day
and when god sends a cheerful hour refrains
it cannot be that in the muse's bower
are men who bartering for their private gain
the lustre of that ancient house would stain
and following those who still for place and power
are striving forfeit all the beauteous dower
bequeathed them  and the virtues' peaceful train
desert and wisdom with her countenance plain
and meek and learning through the midnight hour
still in his studious hermitage
who then
seeing the muse's haunts by ruthless feet
are trodden and by bold and violent men
would wonder if the bard for scenes more meet
for the lone valley and the quiet glen
should quit each venal hall and crowded street
rise genoa rise in beauty from the sea
old doria's blood is flowing in thy veins
rise peerless in thy beauty what remains
of thy old glory is enough for me
flow then ye emerald waters bright and free
and breathe ye orange groves along her plains
ye fountains sparkle through her marble fanes
and hang aloft thou rich and purple sky
hang up thy gorgeous canopy thou sun
shine on her marble palaces that gleam
like silver in thy never dying beam
think of the years of glory she has won
she must not sink before her race is run
nor her long age of conquest seem a dream
look upward on yon desolated pile
and as you mark its ruins lone and grey
mourn not o mourn not for its long decay
but see how gentle nature with a smile
sweet as a mother's anxious to beguile
her infant to her bosom gone astray
calls on the ocean gales from yonder bay
to breathe upon its mouldering towers the while
the fox glove and the wild flower o'er the walls
drop silently their seeds and sun and rain
and summer dews with fairy hands unchain
each granite link and then anon it falls
obedient to that voice which once again
so tenderly her offspring lost recalls
fair art thou scotia the swift mountain stream
gushes with deafening roar and whitening spray
from thy brown hills where eagles seek their prey
or soar undazzled in the solar beam
but dearer far to me be thou my theme
my native hampshire thy sweet valleys gay
trees spires and cots that in the brilliant ray
confusedly glitter like a morning dream
and thou fair forest lovely are thy shades
thy oaks majestic over the billows pale
high spreading their green arms or the deep glades
where the dark holly armed in prickly mail
shelters the yellow fern and tufted blades
that wave responsive to the sighing gale
as in the bursting springtime over the eye
of one who haunts the fields fair visions creep
beneath the closeacuted lids afore dull sleep
dims the quick fancy of sweet flowers that lie
on grassy banks oxlip of orient dye
and palest primrose and blue violet
all in their fresh and dewy beauty set
pictured within the sense and will not fly
so in mine ear resounds and lives again
one mingled melody  a voice a pair
of instruments most voice like of the air
rather than of the earth seems that high strain
a spirit's song and worthy of the train
that soothed old prospero with music rare
i could have lengthened out one fleeting hour
into an age  sitting at set of sun
under the long low open shed where won
the mellow evening light through leaf and flower
playing the hostess in that summer bower
to such dear guests whilst rose the antique song
by those young sister voices poured along
so wild so pure so clear full of sweet power
ringing and vibrating
it was a lay
that sent a smile into the very heart
as when the early lark shoots up in may
with his blithe matins rarer than all art
save this o happiest and most fleeting day
why art thou gone so soon  why must we part
how oft amid the heaped and bedded hay
under the oak's broad shadow deep and strong
have we sat listening to the noon day song
if song it were monotonously gay
which crept along the field the summer lay
of the grasshopper summer is come in pride
of fruit and flower garlanded as a bride
and crowned with corn and graced with length of day
but cold is come with her
we sit not now
listening that merry music of the earth
like arid beneath the blossomed bough
but all for chillness round the social hearth
we cluster  hark a sound of kindred mirth
echoes o wintry cricket welcome thou
sleep on my mother sweet and innocent dreams
attend thee best and dearest dreams that gild
life's clouds like setting suns with pleasures filled
and saintly joy such as thy mind beseems
thy mind where never stormy passion gleams
where their soft nest the dove like virtues build
and calmest thoughts like violets distilled
their fragrance mingle with bright wisdom's beams
sleep on my mother not the lily's bell
so sweet not the enamoured west wind's sighs
that shake the dew drop from her snowy cell
so gentle not that dew drop ere it flies
so pure even slumber loves with thee to dwell
o model most beloved of good and wise
o sweet queen city of the golden south
piercing the evening with thy star lit spires
thou wert a witness when i kissed the mouth
of her whose eyes outblazed the skyey fires
i saw the parallels of thy long streets
with lamps like angels shining all a row
while overhead the empyrean seats
of gods were steeped in paradisic glow
the pleiades with rarer fires were tipt
hesper sat throned upon his jewelled chair
the belted giant's triple stars were dipt
in all the splendour of olympian air
on high to bless the southern cross did shine
like that which blazed o'er conquering constantine
from morn to eve they struggled  life and death
at first it seemed to me that they in mirth
contended and as foes of equal worth
so firm their feet so undisturbed their breath
but when the sharp red sun cut through its sheath
of western clouds i saw the brown arms' girth
tighten and bear that radiant form to earth
and suddenly both fell upon the heath
and then the wonder came  for when i fled
to where those great antagonists down fell
i could not find the body that i sought
and when and where it went i could not tell
one only form was left of those who fought
the long dark form of death  and it was dead
almighty gold whose magic charms dispense
worth to the worthless to the graceless grace
to cowards valour and to blockheads sense
and to the withered maid a hebe's face
poor love exiled thou sitst on hymen's throne
thou rulest the court the senate and the bar
and though the church thy deity disown
some whisper thou hast priest and altar there
all human charities all laws divine
deluded mortals offer at thy shrine
o thou supreme like fate to kill or save
to thy vast empire what is wanting more
nought sighs avaro had it but the power
to silence conscience and to bribe the grave
the child asks is it true the story's old
of a brave youth who all on good intent
alone about the world unwearied went
for love of human kind nor sought for gold
his face was beautiful with thought his hold
of life but frail  as if he had been meant
for gentle ways and could not have been sent
to battle with a world that bought and sold
a wistful far off look grew in his eyes
as if they said to all good night farewell
farewell it was in groves of paradise
a radiant maiden meets him who art thou
he asks for none so fair on earth did dwell
i am thy deeds she says that greet thee now
pray but one prayer for me 'twixt thy closed lips
think but one thought of me up in the stars
the summer night waneth the morning light slips
faint and grey 'twixt the leaves of the aspen betwixt the cloud bars
that are patiently waiting there for the dawn
patient and colourless though heaven's gold
waits to float through them along with the sun
far out in the meadows above the young corn
the heavy elms wait and restless and cold
the uneasy wind rises the roses are dun
through the long twilight they pray for the dawn
round the lone house in the midst of the corn
speak but one word to me over the corn
over the tender bow'd locks of the corn
she wavered stopped and turned methought her eyes
the deep grey windows of her heart were wet
methought they softened with a new regret
to note in mine unspoken miseries
and as a prayer from out my heart did rise
and struggled on my lips in shame's strong net
she stayed me and cried brother our lips met
her dear hands drew me into paradise
sweet seemed that kiss till thence her feet were gone
sweet seemed the word she spake while it might be
as wordless music  but truth fell on me
and kiss and word i knew and left alone
face to face seemed i to a wall of stone
while at my back there beat a boundless sea
the doomed ship drives on helpless through the sea
all that the mariners may do is done
and death is left for men to gaze upon
while side by side two friends sit silently
friends once foes once and now by death made free
of love and hate of all things lost or won
yet still the wonder of that strife bygone
clouds all the hope or horror that may be
thus sorrow are we sitting side by side
amid this welter of the grey despair
nor have we images of foul or fair
to vex save of thy kissed face of a bride
thy scornful face of tears when i was tried
and failed neath pain i was not made to bear
and will the spirit falter and its fire
burn low and slow and die when we grow old
the brain be silent and the heart be cold
and love be old and cold and all desire
be quenched that now higher and higher
immortal fire through dungeon keep and hold
turret and spire of this proud life is rolled
shall this grow cold and cold and then expire
oh let the dream live on the mortal die
the vision thrive the costly form decay
the beauty old and cold all pass away
the spirit higher and higher in fire uprolled
wrap tower and spire and battlement on high
and earth and sky so that it ne'er grow old
whence are these motions of the human soul
itself outside itself wanders and soars
alighting now from old diluvian shores
or where the many mooneacuted planets roll
or the fixed stars gaze round the icy pole
a moment on the threshold of itself
to stand then hide an unsubstantial elf
or eyeless burrow downward like a mole
but all the while as a still sentinel
upon a lonely hill it marks the track
itself hath made and hath the potent spell
its absent self at will to summon back
so several it is and yet so one
such diverse moods that move in unison
love doth not stir my heart sweet love is dead
its cheek is pale its lovely eyelids closed
no not a quiver shakes the lowly bed
where the dear ashen image lies reposed
i can go nigh and lift the mournful veil
i can look down and touch the chiselled lips
remember that they were not always pale
but red  ah rosy red  with smiles and quips
i can do this then pass with but a tear
that tear soon taught to decorate a smile
mayhap adorn a verse to please an ear
that love's sweet music yet will help beguile
ah god so dead to love and yet not dead
would i were with her on her lowly bed
high summer noon yon crow of all his kind
stands indefatigably impudent
a vigilant scout upon a battlement
of his vast fortress underneath him wind
the water courses  open unconfined
to his down peering eye improvident
the bare fields lie in swart abandonment
the hills their tresses thoughtlessly unbind
of fluent silver carelessly displayed
and all the pastures in their morn attire
of flowery robes most gorgeously arrayed
shrink now too late beore the noonday's fire
thus unthrift earth her dainty bosom bares
and on her nakedness heaven's bold eye stares
beside her i could be a thousand years
and talk with her and muse and think i caught
her very spirit and yet catch it not
so subtle is it two translucent spheres
should flash it forth it flames then disappears
a mouth all music should translate it well
it flows like music  whither none can tell
it wraps all senses round soothes charms and cheers
and when we feel peer listen would confine
and grasp its very self it slips away
like the elusive beauty of a day
in autumn leaving of its track no sign
and yet the search we every day renew
pleased to be foiled yet foiled still to pursue
when the great sun sets the glad east aflame
the lingering stars are swiftly put to flight
for day triumphant overthrows the night
and mocks the lights that twinkled till he came
the waning moon retires in sudden shame
and all the air from roseate height to height
quivers with wings of birds that take the light
to jubilant music of one tender name
so thou hast risen  thou who art my day
and every lesser light has ceased to shine
pale stars confronted by this dawn of thine
like night and gloom and grief have passed away
and yet my bliss i fear to call it mine
lest fresh foes lurk with unforeseen dismay
no depth dear love for thee is too profound
there is no farthest height thou mayst not dare
nor shall thy wings fail in the upper air
in funeral robe and wreath my past lies bound
no old time voice assails me with its sound
when thine i hear no former joy seems fair
and now one only thing could bring despair
one grief like compassing seas my life surround
one only terror in my way be met
one great eclipse change my glad day to night
one phantom only turn from red to white
the lips whereon thy lips have once been set
thou knowest well dear love what that must be
the dread of some dark day unshared by thee
where thou art not no day holds light for me
the brightest noontide turns to midnight deep
there no bird sings but awesome shadows creep
persistent ghosts that hold my memory
and walk where joy and hope once walked with thee
and in thy place their lonesome vigil keep
sad shades that haunt the inmost ways of sleep
no kindly morning ever bids them flee
those tireless footsteps will they never cease
like crownless queens they tread their ancient ways
pale phantoms of old dreams and vanished days
and mock my poor endeavors after peace
too long this arctic night too keen its cold
come back strong sun and warm me as of old
you thought o love you loved me then i know
for that i bless you now when love is cold
remembering how warm the tale you told
while winds of autumn fitfully did blow
and by the sea's perpetual ebb and flow
we wandered on together to behold
noon's radiant splendor or the sunset's gold
or beauty of still nights where moons hung low
your voice grew tender when you called my name
i heard that voice to day  was it the same
the old time music trembles in it yet
your touch thrilled through me like a sudden flame
and then love's sweet and subtle madness came
and glad lips clung that now to kiss forget
you surely must remember though to day
there is no spell to charm you in the past
so dear the dream was that it could not last
too soon our pleasant skies were changed to gray
the sun turned from our barren land away
and all the leaves swept by us on the blast
and all our hopes to that wild wind were cast
for dead love's soul there is no place to pray
but still the old time lingers in our thought
in our regretful dreams the old suns rise
and from their shining memory hath caught
some lingering glory of that glad surprise
when love rose on us like the sun and brought
our hearts their morning under last year's skies
time was you heard the music of a sigh
and love awoke and with it song was born
song glad as young birds carol in the morn
and tender as the blue and brooding sky
when all the earth feels spring's warm witchery
and with fresh flowers her bosom doth adorn
and lovers love and cannot love forlorn
since love is of the gods and may not die
in after years may come some wildering light
some sweet delusion followed for a space
such fitful fire flies flash athwart the night
but fade before the shining of that face
which shines upon you still in death's despite
whose steadfast beauty lights till death your days
i do forgive you for the pain i bear
though bitter pain is mingled with my bliss
for still i think while thrilling to your kiss
he found that other woman much more fair
i read your words and see immortal there
another love  how warm it was to this
and know that from my face you still must miss
the beauty that another used to wear
yet i forgive you dear and bow my head
to destiny my master and your own
he sets the way wherein my feet must tread
and if he give me nothing quite mine own
i know some day my heart so sore bested
will rest most quietly and turn to stone
the time will come full soon i shall be gone
and you sit silent in the silent place
with the sad autumn sunlight on your face
remembering the loves that were your own
haunted perchance by some familiar tone
you will be weary then for the dead days
and mindful of their sweet and bitter ways
though passion into memory shall have grown
then will i with your other ghosts draw nigh
and whisper as i pass some former word
some old endearment known in days gone by
some tenderness that once your pulses stirred
which was it spoke to you the wind or i
i think you musing scarcely will have heard
fair was the flower which proffers now its fruit
the bud began to swell 'neath spring's soft dew
and tenderly the winds of summer blew
to foster it and great strong suns were mute
as through its veins warm life began to shoot
and it put on each day some beauty new
and all the fairer as i think it grew
because the streams were tears about its root
but now our fruit hangs well within our reach
and this indeed is time for gathering
it hath the bloom of summer tinted peach
each charm it hath that any man could sing
yet we who taste it whisper each to each
not sweet but very bitter is this thing
chide not because i doubt who would believe
has not my life been like that april day
whose dawn awoke us with such proud display
of mocking glory kindled to deceive
while in the distance low winds seemed to grieve
winds sad with prophecy  then skies grew gray
and all the morning splendor passed away
and dark with rain came on the gusty eve
that was my birthday symbol of my birth
capricious april's heir the sport of fate
doomed to be better friends with grief than mirth
to know no love that did not come too late
my only hope sore spent with life's long pain
in some glad morning to be born again
give me the potent draught that helen poured
to lull telemachus make me forget
all present peril all old sins and let
me dream in peace long threat'ning fate's sharp sword
before my eyes has hung  about me roared
the battle's clamor sore i am beset
new fears and ancient pains together met
assail me who for peace have long implored
give me at last to drink and let them flee
the baffled ghosts that watch me sullenly
to those waste fields that waiting shadows keep
and down some waveless tide in quiet deep
as set of day upon a quiet sea
oh let me drift and dream and fall on sleep
if she unclosed her lips and made her moan
she would not be so weary with her woe
a burden shared is lightened even so
the weight is heavier that we bear alone
and anguish pent within turns hearts to stone
the fellowship of sorrow to forego
to suffer and be silent  is to know
the blackest blossom from the black root grown
and yet great joys and greatest woes are dumb
small is the sum that reckoning can compute
the shallows babble but the depths are mute
the great mid sea our measure may not plumb
king love king pain king death in silence come
and meeting them we silently salute
o wanderer in unknown lands what cheer
how dost thou fare on thy mysterious way
what strange light breaks upon thy distant day
yet leaves me lonely in the darkness here
oh bide no longer in that far off sphere
though all heaven's cohorts should thy footsteps stay
break through their splendid militant array
and answer to my call o dead and dear
i shall not fear thee howsoe'er thou come
thy coldness will not chill though death is cold
a touch and i shall know thee  or a breath
speak the old well known language or be dumb
only come back be near me as of old
so thou and i shall triumph over death
o thou long silent solitary house
where love once came and went with joyous cries
or lingered long sighing as summer sighs
when autumn's breath begins her fear to rouse
with fierce caress that shall make bare her boughs
her tender boughs and all her beauty's prize
deliver faded to the winds that rise
and rend her crown from her dishonored brows
o solitary house thine open door
again shall welcome sweet love's wingèd tread
his eyes shall light thee as they lit of yore
in days when love and joy were newly wed
he shall return with myrtle round his head
and fill thy halls with music as before
i would not have thee warm when i am cold
but both together  'neath some sylvan mound
amid the pleasant secrets under ground
where green things flourish in the embracing mould
and jealous seeds the souls of blossoms hold
in some sweet fellowship of silence bound
deeper than life more exquisite than sound
rest tranquilly while love's new tales are told
we will not grudge the waking world its bliss
its joy of speech its gladness of surprise
when lovers clasp each others hands and kiss
and earth puts on new glory to their eyes
we lying there with death's deep knowledge wise
shall know that we have found life's best in this
far out at sea i hear the wind complain
with the old plaint that vexed my childish ear
and seemed the cry of spirits drawing near
to sob their incommunicable pain
whence did they come and whither go again
my very heart stood still with sudden fear
when the forlorn approach i used to hear
of all the shuddering melancholy train
and lo in this night's vigil far at sea
the same long cry  are they unpardoned yet
does the old pain still goad them till they come
unsheltered souls to sob once more to me
of some dead wrong they never can forget
till there is no more sea and winds are dumb
she bends her beauteous head to taste thy draught
o thou stern angel of the darker cup
with thee to night in the dim shades to sup
where all they be who from that cup have quaffed
she had been clad with loveliness and laughed
at life's strong enemies who lie in wait
had kept with golden youth her queenly state
all unafraid of sorrow's threat'ning shaft
then human grief found out her human heart
and she was fain to go where pain is dumb
so thou wert welcome angel dread to see
and she fares onward with thee willingly
to dwell where no man loves no lovers part
thus grief that is makes welcome death to come
take thou these words thine elder brother writ
thou to whom song is as thy native speech
across the swift flown centuries thou canst reach
to him thy kinsman reverent hands and sit
while shadows of the past about ye flit
with him in sessions of sweet silent thought
and share with him those halcyon days that brought
music's sweet charm and sparkle keen of wit
so shalt thou learn the secret of his song
those minor chords since life is as the leaf
and gladdest love and brightest day are brief
those clear bold notes that told his soul was strong
brave to endure and swift to smite the wrong
until death healed thine elder brother's grief
how shall we know it is the last good by
the skies will not be darkened in that hour
no sudden blight will fall on leaf or flower
no single bird will hush its careless cry
and you will hold my hands and smile or sigh
just as before perchance the sudden tears
in your dear eyes will answer to my fears
but there will come no voice of prophecy
no voice to whisper now and not again
space for last words last kisses and last prayer
for all the wild unmitigated pain
of those who parting clasp hands with despair
who knows we say but doubt and fear remain
would any choose to part thus unaware
i heard one cry out strongly love is dead
and then we went and looked upon his face
turned into marble by death's final grace
his silent lips that once so vainly pled
smile now as men smile being newly wed
since some strange joy life's sorrows did efface
when death's arms clasped him in supreme embrace
all his long pain of living comforted
and you would wake him dare you him recall
from death's enamouring to life's stern pain
make him again the old grief's hopeless thrall
bind him once more with the old clanking chain
and goad him on his weary way again
nay let him rest with death the lord of all
so love is dead that has been quick so long
close then his eyes and bear him to his rest
with eglantine and myrtle on his breast
and leave him there their pleasant scents among
and chant a sweet and melancholy song
about the charms whereof he was possessed
and how of all things he was loveliest
and to compare with aught were him to wrong
leave him beneath the still and solemn stars
that gather and look down from their far place
with their long calm our brief woes to deride
until the sun the morning's gate unbars
and mocks in turn our sorrows with his face
and yet had love been love he had not died
wilt thou forget me in that other sphere
thou who hast shared my life so long in this
and straight grown dizzy with that greater bliss
fronting heaven's splendor strong and full and clear
no longer hold the old embraces dear
when some sweet seraph crowns thee with her kiss
nay surely from that rapture thou wouldst miss
some slight small thing that thou hast cared for here
i do not dream that from those ultimate heights
thou wilt come back to seek me where i bide
but if i follow patient of thy slights
and if i stand there waiting by thy side
surely thy heart with some old thrill will stir
and turn thy face toward me even from her
how long wilt thou be silent lying there
i grieved thee once and now my heart makes moan
cries and thou wilt not answer turned to stone
and pitiless as stone to my despair
my tears fall on thee and thou dost not care
oh art thou cruel now who wast so kind
or only to my sorrow deaf and blind
gone on beyond the hearing of my prayer
shall it not be that in thy brighter life
i find thee move thee to some pitying thrill
and win thee by my pleading to forgive
thou couldst forget past folly and past strife
seeing in that new sphere i love thee still
and thou  didst thou not love thou wouldst not live
when i am dead with mockery of praise
thou shalt not vex the stillness of my sleep
leave me to long tranquillity and deep
who through such weary nights and lonesome days
such hopeless stretch of uncompanioned ways
have come at length my quiet rest to keep
where nettles thrive and careless brambles creep
and things that love the dark their dull brood raise
after my restless years i would have rest
long rest after so many restless years
unmocked by hope set free from haunting fears
since some old pain might waken at thy tread
do thou for once in this my heart's behest
come thou not nigh when i am lying dead
a rose to smell a moment then to leave
chance strain of song you smile at as you pass
bubble that breaks before you lip the glass
chain frail as the frail thread that spiders weave
oh do not think that i myself deceive
thus and not otherwise to you am i
a moment's pleasure as you pass me by
powerless at best to make you joy or grieve
and you to me my sun god and my sun
who warmed my heart to life with careless ray
forever will that burning memory stay
and warm me in the grave when life is done
what farther grace has any woman won
since your chance gift you cannot take away
a gibbering ape that leads an elephant
a dwarf deformed the presence heralding
of potent wizard or the elfin king
caliban deigning sage advice to grant
to mighty prosper in some hour of want
sweet bully bottom while the fairies sing
braying applause to their rich carolling
but feebly typify thy flippant cant
stupid defamer who for many a year
with earth's profoundest teacher wast at school
and notwithstanding does at last appear
a brainless heartless faithless hopeless fool
come take thy cap and bells and throne thee here
conspicuous on the dunce's loftiest stool
the hand of death lay heavy on her eyes
for weeks and weeks her vision had not borne
to meet the tenderest light of eve or morn
to see the crescent moonbeam set or rise
or palest twilight creep across the skies
she lay in darkness seemingly forlorn
with sharp and ceaseless anguish rack'd and torn
yet calm with that one peace which never dies
closed was for her the gate of visual sense
this world and all its beauty lost in night
but the pure soul was all ablaze with light
and through that gloom she saw with gaze intense
celestial glories hid from fleshly sight
and heard angelic voices call her hence
the muses weep around their ancient seat
the streams of stowey heave a piteous moan
the nightingales he loved sit mute and lone
and the sad lars leave not their dumb retreat
the dryads keep within their mossy cells
the flowers there open not at morn nor eve
the hills re echo with a thousand knells
for he is gone for whom all shepherds grieve
he made the sweetest music of them all
and when he sang nor old nor young would stir
you could not even hear the waterfall
while he rehearsed that ancient mariner
or told in accents that like manna fell
the wild and wondrous tale of christabel
troy was for lo to other music now
than in old days bade tower and temple rise
a troy new built of fire to all the skies
with flaming walls o'ertoppeth ida's brow
troy was therein shall we no more behold
the wealth of youth that once made life so fair
see heaven born love our mortal vestures wear
or match with helen's hair earth's paler gold
yet have we lived and battled not in vain
when of that vanished day the tale is told
if once within the hero ranks enrolled
we lived their higher life of heart and brain
though of a phantom beauty we were fain
though for a failing cause our hearts grew bold
not spring  too lavish of her bud and leaf
but autumn with sad eyes and brow austere
when fields are bare and woods are brown and sere
and leaden skies weep their exhaustless grief
spring is so much too bright since spring is brief
and in our hearts is autumn all the year
least sad when the wide pastures are most drear
and fields grieve most robbed of the last gold sheaf
for when the plough goes down the brown wet field
a delicate doubtful throb of hope is ours
what if this coming spring at last should yield
joy with her too profuse unasked for flowers
not all our springs of commonplace and pain
have taught us now that autumn hope is vain
not summer's crown of scent the red rose weaves
not hawthorn perfume blown o'er bloom strewn grass
not violets' whispers as the children pass
nor new mown hay crisp scent of yellow sheaves
nor lilac perfume in the soft may eves
nor any scent that springtime can amass
or summer squander such a magic has
as scent of fresh wet earth and fallen leaves
for sometimes lovers in november days
when earth is grieving for the vanished sun
have trod dead leaves in chill and wintry ways
and kissed and dreamed eternal summer won
look back look back through memory's deepening haze
see  two who dreamed that dream and you were one
while yet the woods were hardly more than brown
filled with the stillness of the dying day
the folds and farms and faint green pastures lay
and bells chimed softly from the gray walled town
the dark fields with the corn and poppies sown
the dark delicious dreamy forest way
the hope of april for the soul of may
on all of these night's wide soft wings swept down
one yellow star pierced through the clear pure sky
and showed above the network of the wood
the silence of whose crowded solitude
was broken but by little woodland things
rustling dead leaves with restless feet and wings
and by a kiss that ended in a sigh
the wind of morn awoke before the line
of dawn's pearl haze made pale the eastern sky
and woke the birds and woodland creatures shy
and sighed night's dirge through tremulous boughs of pine
the north and south sky flushed and the divine
rose radiance touched the moorland lone and high
while still the wood was dusk where by and by
splendid and strong the risen sun should shine
it shone  on two that through the woodland came
with eyes averted and cold hands that clung
and weary lips that knew forbidden things
and hearts made sick with vain imaginings
and over all the wood its glory flung
the wood  that never more could be the same
the flood of utter change is loosed  a space
is ours yet for its coming to prepare
shall we build dams with cautious clumsy care
or stand with idle hands and frightened face
and so be whirled all broken from our place
or perish with the dams we builded there
or shall we dig a broad deep channel where
most fields may feel the flood's benign embrace
thus turned 'twill be a calm majestic flood
of plenty peace and fertilising power
whose banks fresh flowers of love and joy shall deck
oppose it at the inevitable hour
tumultuous black with ruin red with blood
'twill come  and you shall have no chance but wreck
the raindrops shimmered down the beamy sky
behold one sang how gloriously bright
the golden garments of the king of light
golden o drop a beam is in thine eye
a second cries his robe's of crimson dye
ye both are blind another shouts my sight
is clear and with the purple veil of night
our monarch is arrayed in mystery
thus wrangling shouting hopeless to agree
the drops shot swiftly down the headlong steep
until at last they fell into the sea
when they arose from out the cold dark deep
the sun sat throned in stainless majesty
while down a cloud they saw the rainbow sweep
in the cold change which time hath wrought on love
the snowy winter of his summer prime
should a chance sigh or sudden tear drop move
thy heart to memory of the olden time
turn not to gaze on me with pitying eyes
nor mock me with a withered hope renewed
but from the bower we both have loved arise
and leave me to my barren solitude
what boots it that a momentary flame
shoots from the ashes of a dying fire
we gaze upon the hearth from whence it came
and know the exhausted embers must expire
therefore no pity or my heart will break
be cold be careless  for thy past love's sake
silent companions of the lonely hour
friends who can never alter or forsake
who for inconstant roving have no power
and all neglect perforce must calmly take
let me return to you this turmoil ending
which worldly cares have in my spirit wrought
and o'er your old familiar pages bending
refresh my mind with many a tranquil thought
till haply meeting there from time to time
fancies the audible echo of my own
'twill be like hearing in a foreign clime
my native language spoke in friendly tone
and with a sort of welcome i shall dwell
on these my unripe musings told so well
poets write things in which they don't believe
what does this mean we don't believe in love
we don't believe that adam and that eve
our ancient parents heard a voice above
telling them not to eat that apple of
knowledge of right and wrong no none of these
it means belief which none of us may prove
is not our function those are privacies
specific to the soul that waits release
from bondage to the body to its greater
lasting and uncommemorative peace
that happens after death and even later
what poets don't believe in meaning death
was proved fallacious ere they drew their breath
submission to the will of god is good
yet what the will of god is none can say
though many people have it understood
and gladly condescend to show the way
the lord wills this the lord wills that one hears
as if they have a secret channel to
his innermost desire   their hopes and fears
as congruous with what he'd have them do
when christians came and brought the bible we
possessed the land but now we have the bible
they the land   wherefore servility
is preached and blasphemy a form of libel
so creeds have ever confiscated booty
and yoked the dispossessed to heaven's duty
lithe limbs my limbs did once enfold
soft lips my lips did parting kiss
such grace as man may once behold
then parting from forever miss
sweet breath with my breath intermingled
as passion pressed us close together
in unison as bodies tingled
not knowing which was either neither
light murmured words of deep import
as tuned my ear to their caressing
as gentleness became our sport
gentility our only blessing
wild days of love yet numbered few
and since 'tis years since i had you
soft spoken mild obedient
a good girl who believes in god
such was the blessing i was sent
who let me love her mind and bod
she wasn't old but she was wise
in how a woman serves a man
and gives him not just sweetest eyes
but her allegiance as she can
devotion lord and rites of passion
as in the holy name fulfilled
not jealousy nor quest for fashion
to ever see his passion killed
forgive me lord if it is wrong
for many loves as this to long
lord if thy will permits it please
forgive my errors of the past
and me to better days release
from misspent hopes and fears miscast
lord if my body lets me have
the fairer sex to hold as mine
but as a lover not a slave
obedient to things divine
and if thy will permits it lord
a harem and seraglio
but pleasant not some angry hoard
where i may keep my women so
so let me if thou canst approve
but let me not forsake thy love
forgive me god if this is wrong
but i believe it isn't so
for i have had this passion strong
since in my early days of woe
but let thy will be done not mine
and what i ask for never be
unless with thy intent divine
the hopes i have don't disagree
i'd rather be a pauper poor
devoid of even slightest ease
than have fulfilled this wish and more
if with thy will it disagrees
thy mercy lord is all i ask
to teach me to fulfill thy task
lord this i never had to ask
did she my older love remain
without whom life's a loathsome task
but full of sorrow strife and pain
had she been faithful fair and true
much as she promised me to be
and not to do as women do
which i believed   so look at me
my heart and soul to her i gave
naive because i loved too well
a person i might never have
nor what we had must ever tell
wherefore dear lord do i beseech
to compass loves within my reach
these names i keep repeating such as keats
and hopkins part of the unique succession
of poetry's transmission each one meets
make up my rosary hear my confession
these names make up my mantra i repeat
my japa in my fervid state of mind
when other thoughts have all been obsolete
in guiding me to where i am inclined
what is this madness lord what this despair
tormenting me and seemingly unceasing
when all my efforts lead me to no where
and all my burdens seem to be increasing
their thought the same weird journey having taken
doth comfort me   that yet may be mistaken
dear god a life as lived between extremes
either the one intractable enforcement
of chastity that's anchored to false dreams
pretending to morality's endorsement
or else the opposite abandonment
of all pretense to individuation
in love's pursuit to moral decrement
these both i've known but never mediation
god like as land that suffers dearth and flood
in alternating waves thus have i been
either too cold or else too hot the blood
and never gradiation in between
now after years of heaven years of hell
my body that was strong is but a shell
hast dropped thy litter pregnant calico
and thou a pup thyself   i see thou art
less full in belly which before did show
rotund thy load not nature's plan athwart
so young   the neighbors seeing one depart
its comfort's confines of thy heaving womb
did say of thee she ran off with a start
with that old tom   i asked who old grey tom
like as to implicate thee as a mom
unfit for child rearing they the kitten
did scoop so they did say to take to home
they with its weak debility all smitten
yet unfit moms so called are often fitter
than high bred dames like these to have a litter
one must be strong but father it is hard
so hard when all about us we observe
that falsehood and deceit seem to reward
while truth and faith most torture that most serve
this all have seen   and justice only known
by its heartwrenching absence in man¹s world
the ancient confidence to heaven flown
or else down to the craggy hellholds hurled
yet lord deliver me from the deserved
for what do i deserve but death most foul
forgive me in that i have greatly swerved
from thine intent and nearly lost my soul
an hundred times and body all unnerved
an hundred hundred times   lord keep me whole
so i and thou it could be me and you
kiddo but that was once and might have been
but this is now and i forever true
could not have been in light of what i¹ve seen
for i have seen abjectly the reversal
of every thought i thought i ever had
my empty bag now scattered for dispersal
its contents mostly good when they are bad
so furthermore on thee i lavish praise
to mock myself that is cheap counterfeit
of thee derived from thee whom i always
do plunder for my thought's unlettered writ
so so it goes thou reader stand unfazed
for if you saw her face you'd be amazed
this is a rune i ravelled in the still
arrogant stare of an australian cow
these prankt intruders of the hornless brow
puffed up with strange illusions of their skill
to fence to milk to fatten and to kill
once worshipped me with temple rite and vow
crowned me with stars and bade rapt millions bow
before what abject guess they called my will
today this flunkey of my midden man
throws child oblations in my milking byre
stifles in slums to spare me lordly fields
flatters with spotless consorts my desire
and for a pail of cream his birthright yields
as once in egypt hellas ind iran
last sea thing dredged by sailor time from space
are you adrift sargasso where the west
in halcyon calm rebuilds her fatal nest
or delos of a coming sun god's race
are you for light and trimmed with oil in place
or but a will o' wisp on marshy quest
a new demesne for mammon to infest
or lurks millennial eden 'neath your face
the cenotaphs of species dead elsewhere
that in your limits leap and swim and fly
or trail uncanny harpstrings from your trees
mix omens with the auguries that dare
to plant the cross upon your forehead sky
a virgin helpmate ocean at your knee
our manlier spirits hear and will obey
the word you waft australia o'er the sea
'be true be brave be merciful be free'
not you who braggart sent this wan array
of hell ships vomiting their will to slay
these armoured hates and pallid envies we
'mid rattled mobs and flags hysteric see
tarnish the chaste horizon of our bay
but you we hear our comrades of the cause
who face hyaena mammon in his den
and you who dared your seas of blood to spill
to drag the swooning slave from vampire jaws
yea you who freed unborn australia when
you singed king george's beard at bunker's hill
this love that dares not warm before its flame
our yearning hands or from its tempting tree
yield fruit we may consume or let us claim
in hymen's scroll of happy heraldry
the twining glyphs of perfect you and me
may kindle social fires whence curls no blame
find gardens where no fruits forbidden be
and mottoes weave unsullied by a shame
for love unmothered childhood wanly waits
for such as you to cherish it to youth
raw social soils untilled need love's own verve
that peace a flower may oust their weedy hates
and where distress would faint from wolfish sleuth
the perfect lovers' symbol is we serve
yet what were love if man remains unfree
and woman's sunshine sordid merchandise
if children's hope is blasted ere they see
its shoots of youth from out the branchlets rise
if thought is chained and gagged is speech and lies
enthroned as law befoul posterity
and haggard sin's ubiquitous disguise
insults the face of god where'er men be
ay what were love my love did we not love
our stricken brothers so as to resign
for its own sake the foison of its dower
that so we two may help them mount above
these layers of charnel air in which they pine
to seek with us the presence and the power
too many a samsan lip your teeth indent
too many a sybil girl you lure to make
the great refusal for a fireside sake
and glamoured poet many a look has sent
into those eyeballs bear brown somnolent
nor dreamed that devils in each muddy lake
were sucking his devotion in to slake
the furrowed belly of your fanged content
religion's bane and freedom's subtlest foe
behold the poppied freight your barges bring
the dim lit souls that crave the prophet's gleam
or fettered people's writhing 'neath their woe
gossamer clips and thriftless harvesting
of phantom flocks and shadowy tilth of dream
my dreams dissolve the day's illusive net
while crested action's billows blinding beat
omniscient eyes in troughs of faith i meet
i wait with ancient stars until they set
lest forward progress should their runes forget
i am the rest that makes the bar complete
and in the shackled body of defeat
the womb of baby triumph living yet
i am the blende of sleeping radiance
the siding where belated industry
draws from a silent tank tomorrow's zest
prophetic art's preparatory trance
dilating force's sabbath systole
the night of brahm when worn creators rest
black drips the ooze that you secrete on all
that honour's burin graves or love holds dear
at sacrifice you laugh at virtue sneer
and sour rebellion's must the waking thrall
would ripen into freedom with the gall
of green suspicion god of drones you hear
mutter of plots in all success on seer
and saint behold your own foul motives crawl
o gluttony that would but dare not gorge
theft of the heart that dreads the handcuff hate
too cowardly to hurl the bolts you forge
and lust that fears to pluck the flowers you smell
too low your lintel to seduce the great
the meanest of the seven doors of hell
now memory false spendthrift memory
disloyal treasure keeper of the soul
this vision change shall never wring from thee
nor wasteful years effacing as they roll
o steel blue lake high cradled in the hills
o sad waves filled with little sobs and cries
white glistening shingle hiss of mountain rills
and granite hearted walls blotting the skies
shine sob gleam gloom for ever oh in me
be what you are in nature  a recess
to sadness dedicate and mystery
withdrawn afar in the soul's wilderness
still let my thoughts leaving the worldly roar
like pilgrims wander on thy haunted shore
each orpheus must unto the depths descend
for only thus the poet can be wise
must make the sad persephone his friend
and buried love to second life arise
again his love must lose through too much love
must lose his life by living life too true
for what he sought below is passed above
already done is all that he would do
must tune all being with his single lyre
must melt all rocks free from their primal pain
must search all nature with his one soul's fire
must bind anew all forms in heavenly chain
if he already sees what he must do
well may he shade his eyes from the far shining view
here sleep'st thou man of soul thy spirit flown
how dark and tenantless its desert clay
cold is that heart which throbbed at sorrow's moan
untuned that tongue that charmed the social day
where now the wit by generous roughness graced
or friendship's accent kindling as it fell
or bounty's stealing foot whose step untraced
had watched pale want and stored her famished cell
alas 'tis all thou art whose vigorous mind
inspiring force to truth and feeling gave
whose rich resources equal power combined
the gay to brighten and instruct the grave
farewell adieu sweet peace thy vigils keep
for pilgrim virtue sojourns here to weep
fair was the face of this illumined dawn
with vernal brightness vernal softness fair
the sun incessant wooed the blushing morn
and all the youthful hours laughed round the pair
but ere the evening what a change was there
harsh thunders roll and fork~ lightnings fly
hiemal tempests brood along the air
or fall in torrents from an angry sky
ah scarce less mutable is man's brief day
soon are his early prospects clouded o'er
and those soft suns that shot their april ray
across his primrose pathway shine no more
grief on the present drops her tearful showers
and apprehension over the future lours
romantic guardians of this peaceful vale
that over yon raftered shed raise high your brow
say does some wizard up your cleft side scale
and like a blighted pollard seem to grow
wrapped in the mazy windings of the dale
do elfin monarchs hold their court below
or down the devious rill by moonlight sail
their bark a shell a grassy blade their prow
whate'er your residents whate'er their task
to shield the sounding cliff or springs unlock
whether they now in sloping sunbeams bask
or doze till midnight in the rifted rock
still let a stranger mark their hallowed reign
and hear in rising winds their mystic strain
if to be praised by those who merit praise
gives honour as some sapient sages deemed
if by the bland in heart to be esteemed
gives comfort and the drooping thought can raise
if where the dignity of elder days
and high nobility of souls have beamed
an inborn radiance sympathy hath gleamed
with kindred warmth and shot some roseate rays
and with benignant tenderness hath cheered
my lonesome hours whom widowed anguish led
through sorrow's sablest gloom how much endeared
is brydges by each muse and grace bestead
for he my lettered friend my social pride
hath honour comfort solace joy supplied
when you and i have play'd the little hour
have seen the tall subaltern life to death
yield up his sword and smiling draw the breath
the first long breath of freedom when the flower
of recompense hath flutter'd to our feet
as to an actor's and the curtain down
we turn to face each other all alone
alone we two who never yet did meet
alone and absolute and free o then
o then most dear how shall be told the tale
clasp'd hands press'd lips and so clasp'd hands again
no words but as the proud wind fills the sail
my love to yours shall reach then one deep moan
of joy and then our infinite alone
art's use what is it but to touch the springs
of nature but to hold a torch up for
humanity in life's large corridor
to guide the feet of peasants and of kings
what is it but to carry union through
thoughts alien to thoughts kindred and to merge
the lines of colour that should not diverge
and give the sun a window to shine through
what is it but to make the world have heed
for what its dull eyes else would hardly scan
to draw in a stark light a shameless deed
and show the fashion of a kingly man
to cherish honour and to smite all shame
to lend hearts voices and give thoughts a name
it is enough that in this burdened time
the soul sees all its purposes aright
the rest  what does it matter soon the night
will come to whelm us then the morning chime
what does it matter if but in the way
one hand clasps ours one heart believes us true
one understands the work we try to do
and strives through love to teach us what to say
between me and the chilly outer air
which blows in from the world there standeth one
who draws love's curtains closely everywhere
as god folds down the banners of the sun
warm is my place about me and above
where was the raven i behold the dove
i count the mercifullest part of all
god's mercies in this coil of eighty years
is that no sense of being disappears
or fails i see the signal hear the call
can calmly estimate the rise and fall
of moth like mortals in this vale of tears
and all his glorious works  the heavenly spheres
the ocean and the earth's unending wall
remain for thought and wonder  marvellous
is god's creation with its endless space
and those inhabited bright worlds by law
divinely governed as they shine on us
still keeping through all time their ordered place
i bow my head in rapture and in awe
could i have sung one song that should survive
the singer's voice and in my country's heart
find loving echo  evermore a part
of all her sweetest memories could i give
one great thought to the people that should prove
the spring of noble action in their hour
of darkness or control their headlong power
with the firm reins of justice and of love
could i have traced one form that should express
the sacred mystery that underlies
all beauty and through man's enraptured eyes
teach him how beautiful is holiness
i had not feared thee but to yield my breath
life's purpose unfulfilled  this is thy sting o death
o sleep good mother of enchanting dreams
within thy soothing arms oh let me lie
what time the night wind sings a lullaby
and the moon kisses down with cooling gleams
mine eyelids weary of day's sultry beams
then let thy rarest visions come anigh
dead hopes fulfilled in perfect radiancy
whose fairness all my waking pain redeems
with loline let me stray through jasmine bowers
a balmy world of love whose stars are flowers
where zephyrs sigh in such a tender way
they seem to breathe the words we long to say
and when these dreams have come good sleep ah then
i pray thee do not let me wake again
whence comest thou shady lane and why and how
thou where with idle heart ten years ago
i wandered and with childhood's paces slow
so long unthought of and remembered now
again in vision clear thy pathwayed side
i tread and view thy orchard plots again
with yellow fruitage hung  and glimmering grain
standing or shocked through the thick hedge espied
this hot still noon of august brings the sight
this quelling silence as of eve or night
wherein earth feeling as a mother will
after her travail's latest bitterest throes
looks up so seemeth it one half repose
one half in effort straining suffering still
if it is thou whose casual hand withdraws
what it at first as casually did make
say what amount of ages it will take
with tardy rare concurrences of laws
and subtle multiplicities of cause
the thing they once had made us to remake
may hopes dead slumbering dare to reawake
even after utmost interval of pause
what revolutions must have passed before
the great celestial cycles shall restore
the starry sign whose present hour is gone
what worse than dubious chances interpose
with cloud and sunny gleam to recompose
the skiey picture we had gazed upon
that children in their loveliness should die
before the dawning beauty which we know
cannot remain has yet begun to go
that when a certain period has passed by
people of genius and of faculty
leaving behind them some result to show
having performed some function should forgo
the task which younger hands can better ply
appears entirely natural
but that one
whose perfectness did not at all consist
in things towards forming which time can have done
anything  whose sole office was to exist
should suddenly dissolve and cease to be
is the extreme of all perplexity
yes i have lied and so must walk my way
bearing the liar's curse upon my head
letting my weak and sickly heart be fed
on food which does the present craving stay
but may be clean denied me e'en today
and though 'twere certain yet were ought but bread
letting  for so they say it seems i said
and i am all too weak to disobey
therefore for me sweet nature's scenes reveal not
their charm sweet music greets me and i feel not
sweet eyes pass off me uninspired yea more
the golden tide of opportunity
flows wafting in friendships and better  i
unseeing listless pace along the shore
here am i yet another twelvemonth spent
one third departed of the mortal span
carrying on the child into the man
nothing into reality sails rent
and rudder broken  reason impotent
affections all unfixed so forth i fare
on the mid seas unheedingly so dare
to do and to be done by well content
so was it from the first so is it yet
yea the first kiss that by these lips was set
on any human lips methinks was sin
sin cowardice and falsehood for the will
into a deed e'en then advanced wherein
god unidentified was thought of still
that children in their loveliness should die
before the dawning beauty which we know
cannot remain has yet begun to go
that when a certain period has passed by
people of genius and of faculty
leaving behind them some result to show
having performed some function should forego
a task which younger hands can better ply
appears entirely natural but that one
whose perfectness did not at all consist
in things towards forming which time could have done
anything  whose sole office was to exist
should suddenly dissolve and cease to be
calls up the hardest questions
that there are better things within the womb
of nature than to our unworthy view
she grants for a possession may be true
the cycle of the birthplace and the tomb
fulfils at least the order and the doom
of her that has not ordinance to do
more than to withdraw and to renew
to show one moment and the next resume
the law that we return from whence we came
may for the flowers beasts and most men remain
if for ourselves we ask not nor complain
but for a being that demands the name
we highest deem  a person and a soul
it troubles us if this should be the whole
to see the rich autumnal tints depart
and view the fading of the roseate glow
that veils some alpine altitude of snow
to hear some mighty masterpiece of art
lost or destroyed may to the adult heart
impatient of the transitory show
of lovelinesses that but come and go
a positive strange thankfulness impart
when human pure perfections disappear
not at the first but at some later day
the buoyancy of such reaction may
with strong assurance conquer blank dismay
but if as not by what the soul desired
swayed in the judgment wisest men have thought
and furnishing the evidence it sought
man's heart hath ever fervently required
and story for that reason deemed inspired
to every clime in every age hath taught
if in this human complex there be aught
not lost in death as not in birth acquired
o then though cold the lips that did convey
rich freights of meaning dead each living sphere
where thought abode and fancy loved to play
thou yet we think somewhere somehow still art
and satisfied with that the patient heart
the where and how doth not desire to hear
if it is thou whose casual hand withdraws
what it at first as casually did make
say what amount of ages it will take
with tardy rare concurrences of laws
and subtle multiplicities of cause
the thing they once had made us to remake
may hopes dead slumbering dare to reawake
e'en after utmost interval of pause
what revolutions must have passed before
the great celestial cycles shall restore
the starry sign whose present hour is gone
what worse than dubious chances interpose
with cloud and sunny gleam to recompose
the skiey picture we had gazed upon
but whether in the uncoloured light of truth
this inward strong assurance be indeed
more than the self willed arbitrary creed
manhood's inheritor to the dream of youth
whether to shut out fact because forsooth
to live were insupportable unfreed
be not or be the service of untruth
whether this vital confidence be more
than his who upon death's immediate brink
knowing perforce determines to ignore
or than the bird's that when the hunter comes
burying her eyesight can forget her fear
who about this shall tell us what to think
shall i decide it by a random shot
our happy hopes so happy and so good
are not mere idle motions of the blood
and when they seem most baseless most are not
a seed there must have been upon the spot
where the flowers grow without it ne'er they could
the confidence of growth least understood
of some deep intuition was begot
what if despair and hope alike be true
the heart 'tis manifest is free to do
whichever nature and itself suggest
and always 'tis a fact that we are here
and with being here doth palsy giving fear
whoe'er can ask or hope accord the best
am i not all alone  the world is still
in passionless slumber  not a tree but feels
the far pervading hush and softer steals
the misty river by yon broad bare hill
looks coldly up to heaven and all the stars
seem eyes deep fixed in silence as if bound
by some unearthly spell  no other sound
but the owl's unfrequent moan  their airy cars
the winds have stationed on the mountain peaks
am i not all alone  a spirit speaks
from the abyss of night not all alone
nature is round thee with her banded powers
and ancient genius haunts thee in these hours
mind and its kingdom now are all thine own
whence whither where  a taper point of light
my life and world  the infinite around
a sea not even highest thought can sound
a formless void unchanging endless night
in vain the struggling spirit aims its flight
to the empyrean seen as is a star
sole glimmering through the hazy night afar
in vain it beats its wings with daring might
what yonder gleams what heavenly shapes arise
from out the bodiless waste behold the dawn
sent from on high uncounted ages gone
burst full and glorious on my wondering eyes
sun clear the world around and far away
a boundless future sweeps in golden day
stern be the pilot in the dreadful hour
when a great nation like a ship at sea
with the wroth breakers whitening at her lee
feels her last shudder if her helmsman cower
a godlike manhood be his mighty dower
such and so gifted lincoln may'st thou be
with thy high wisdom's low simplicity
and awful tenderness of voted power
from our hot records then thy name shall stand
on time's calm ledger out of passionate days
with the pure debt of gratitude begun
and only paid in never ending praise
one of the many of a mighty land
made by god's providence the anointed one
thou sleep'st in marble now o west still first
upon the roll of fame thy name appears
thy name decreed to reach the latest years
despite the taint of envious breath accurst
and copley too thy spirit proud hast burst
but turn we to the living bright compeers
our stuart allston ripe of age time sears
not that this burns with an immortal thirst
who next shall follow in the march of time
see trumbull anxious for a deathless name
see vanderlyn see ardent sully climb
and leslie newton tread the paths of fame
urge then the generous race ye chosen few
and let apelles raphael live in you
science true daughter of old time thou art
who alterest all things with thy peering eyes
why preyest thou thus upon the poet's heart
vulture whose wings are dull realities
how should he love thee or how deem thee wise
who wouldst not leave him in his wandering
to seek for treasure in the jewelled skies
albeit he soared with an undaunted wing
hast thou not dragged diana from her car
and driven the hamadryad from the wood
to seek a shelter in some happier star
hast thou not torn the naiad from her flood
the elfin from the green grass and from me
the summer dream beneath the tamarind tree
seldom we find says solomon don dunce
half an idea in the profoundest sonnet
through all the flimsy things we see at once
as easily as through a naples bonnet
trash of all trash  how can a lady don it
yet heavier far than your petrarchan stuff
owl downy nonsense that the faintest puff
twirls into trunk paper while you con it
and veritable sol is right enough
the general tuckermanities are arrant
bubbles  ephemeral and so transparent
but this is now  you may depend on it
stable opaque immortal  all by dint
of the dear names that lie concealed within't
there are some qualities  some incorporate things
that have a double life which thus is made
a type of that twin entity which springs
from matter and light evenced in solid and shade
there is a two fold silence  sea and shore
body and soul one dwells in lonely places
newly with grass o'ergrown some solemn graces
some human memories and tearful lore
render him terrorless his name's no more
he is the corporate silence dread him not
no power hath he of evil in himself
but should some urgent fate untimely lot
bring thee to meet his shadow nameless elf
that haunteth the lone regions where hath trod
no foot of man commend thyself to god
fair isle that from the fairest of all flowers
thy gentlest of all gentle names dost take
how many memories of what radiant hours
at sight of thee and thine at once awake
how many scenes of what departed bliss
how many thoughts of what entombed hopes
how many visions of a maiden that is
no more  no more upon thy verdant slopes
no more alas that magical sad sound
transforming all thy charms shall please no more
thy memory no more accursed ground
henceforth i hold thy flower enameled shore
o hyacinthine isle o purple zante
isola d'oro fior di levante
oh fatal dream what forms of dire dismay
frantic i range beneath the damps of night
i sat methought where death and pale affright
on clara frowned  i saw the subtle ray
of life recede  the loved the lovely lay
convulsed with pain  no more her eyes were bright
her soul the gentle mansion of delight
was reft the beauteous frame was turned to clay
with piercing shrieks i tore the silent gloom
of awful night the cruel phantom fled
yet scarce will fear my waking senses trust
still still it paints thy beauties turned to dust
o clara clara wert thou with the dead
thy lover soon would follow to the tomb
now he recalleth his triumphant days
and fervid throes of equatorial fire
thrill through his frame till re aroused desire
his dream so shows him all his desert ways
to lap the scented blood of what he slays
lifts him upon his feet a lurid ire
burns in his eyes a shaggy horror stays
his mane erect in aspect grim and dire
his eyes that are the mirror of his dream
as slowly from their deeps the vision fades
lose all the light wherewith they blazed and shone
his limbs relent and all the savage gleam
droops in his mane to ever gloomier shades
and with his sleep his royal mood is gone
our fate is round us like a viewless net
woven of thoughts inheritances deeds
and all the drift of circumstantial weeds
about the shores of being that are set
imponderable strands no mortal fret
hath power to fray the inevitable seeds
sown by the gods along the cosmic meads
the gods who sow and never know regret
throw round us their invisible intents
webs knitted in the house of destiny
enmesh the yearning visage of the soul
and though it cry the sequence of events
the march and order of the mighty whole
remain unchanged through all eternity
roses i saw and poppies all alight
with colours of the dawn and rainbow hues
drawn from the sun and all the secret dews
distilled upon them from the brooding night
and delicate sweet peas so purely dight
they must have grown where icy winds refuse
to blow or haply where nuns dream and muse
in holy meditation out of sight
of the rough world  flowers of moonlight sheen
and golden hearts and velvet pansies turned
the room they stood in to a garden scene
of loveliness so exquisite i yearned
through all my soul to be as chastely clean
as these and more my raptured eye discerned
lo all the land is dry and parched with heat
and all the hills are white with withered grass
that hath no touch of greenness and alas
see how the lately waving fields of wheat
droop wearily towards a sure defeat
before the scorching winds that hourly pass
over the arid earth how like a glass
the hot flats shimmer underneath the heat
more strenuous as the stifling weeks increase
of quenchless and unmitigable rays
that make a terror of the rainless days
and the clear vault of fire that will not cease
to heap with death the long and dusty ways
and burn out life from all the leafless trees
green grass green trees and greenest wildernesses
of cool green ferns and ah such long green spaces
sleeping within the sunlight's warm embraces
green shadowed rills that gurgle through green cresses
and deep green nooks wherein the locust dresses
her shining wings green dells and high green places
o'er which bright swarms of sportive insect graces
flash and are gone and know not what distress is
green covered spots green fields where greenness less is
by reason of the clouds of blowing daisies
that variegate the verdure with their faces
green arbours where all greenest loveliness is
like little billowy puffs of maiden tresses
all these leave on the soul their joyous traces
slow mists were on the ridges all around
and in the kloofs and on the mountain side
they moved and swayed a softly flowing tide
that rose against the rocks without a sound
then circled back upon the lower ground
in folding mazes that would not abide
a moment there but wandered far and wide
in billowy waves no shores were set to bound
our raptured souls were in that magic sea
and in those wreaths that journeyed with the wind
were all our thoughts and in each eager mind
the beauty of that morning mystery
became an exultation yet to be
remembered when our mortal eyes are blind
what witching hours of wild delight are here
what amplitude of healing airs that sweep
downward to rouse the dreamers from their sleep
far in unhealthful valleys and what cheer
of gleeful laughter wins the soul from fear
to gambol on these lusty heights like sheep
glad with the spring in what still pools and deep
shine spaces of the crystal atmosphere
what flowers are here what scented dells of shade
what carols make the mornings musical
what fragrant coils of everlastings glow
in secret spots along each sinuous glade
what luminous waters rush and pause to fall
what exultations through the spirit flow
what blackness reigned before a star was born
when far across void spaces of the night
the pale diaphanous wonder of the dawn
rose ghostlike on the unaccustomed sight
of all the unimaginable eyes
strange creatures of the darkness sure were bred
that stared towards the east in wild surmise
to see the changing colours throb and spread
innumerable films of rosy fire
flushing the orient with their glowing tints
clothing the haggard plains in rich attire
and flashing from great hills of naked flints
until the gaunt and hungry earth displayed
the jewelled splendour of a queen arrayed
ah god the gulf between us is too dark
too deep and dark and terrible to cross
if either now should launch a venturing bark
the surging breakers would assail and toss
and rend it into pieces it would fare
on these fell waters that between us scream
and fling fierce arms of hatred through the air
like some frail atom in a demon's dream
yea it would perish and go down to doom
in ravenous swirls of chaos like a dove
caught in mid riot of the crash and boom
of fire and rain and thunder from above
there where thou livest in pure light divine
smile and again this whole dark earth will shine
o weary watcher waiting at the well
she cannot come to fill thy aching brain
with thoughts as sweet as nectar in a cell
or bright as flowers in a dreamy dell
her individual force is spent in vain
thou yearnest for the touch that eases pain
no longer can she weave her mystic spell
for she is now a part of all around
a spirit and an essence a desire
an inspiration in the heart of things
that murmurs in the harmony of sound
is white in lilies red in flaming fire
and everlasting in recurring springs
yea is it so will death relieve the soul
of its most secret and inveterate sin
will all be altered when behind the goal
set to the flesh the spirit shall pass in
it cannot be as we have lived we die
prone in the arms of our unrighteous deeds
at the last moment we shall surely lie
and so pass forth nothing there is but breeds
the thing it is evil shall still be so
though spirit borne into ethereal ways
yet there perchance a stronger will may grow
to do some work which god may bless with praise
as being good a new environment
remoulds us till we lose the old intent
lo where he crouches by the kloof's dark side
eyeing the farmer's lowing herds afar
impatient watching till the evening star
leads forth the twilight dim that he may glide
like panther to the prey with freeborn pride
he scorns the herdsman nor regards the scar
of recent wound but burnishes for war
his assegai and targe of buffalo hide
he is a robber true it is a strife
between the black skinned bandit and the white
a savage yes though loth to aim at life
evil for evil fierce he doth requite
a heathen teach him then thy better creed
christian if thou deserv'st that name indeed
the bushman sleeps within his black browed den
in the lone wilderness around him lie
his wife and little ones unfearingly
for they are far away from christian men
no herds loud lowing call him down the glen
he fears no foe but famine and may try
to wear away the hot noon slumberingly
then rise to search for roots  and dance again
but he shall dance no more his secret lair
surrounded echoes to the thundering gun
and the wild shriek of anguish and despair
he dies  yet ere life's ebbing sands are run
leaves to his sons a curse should they be friends
with the proud christian men  for they are fiends
not altogether wicked but so weak
that greater villains made of him their tool
not void of talent yet so much a fool
as honour by dishonest means to seek
proud to the humble to the haughty meek
in flattery servile insolent in rule
keen for his own for others' interest cool
hate in his heart and smiles upon his cheek
this man with abject meanness join'd to pride
was yet a pleasant fellow in his day
for all unseemly traits he well could hide
whene'er he mingled with the great and gay
but he is buried now  and when he died
no one seemed sorry that he was away
mild melancholy and sedate he stands
tending another's flock upon the fields
his father's once where now the white man builds
his home and issues forth his proud commands
his dark eye flashes not his listless hands
lean on the shepherd's staff no more he wields
the libyan bow  but to the oppressor yields
submissively his freedom and his lands
has he no courage once he had  but lo
harsh servitude hath worn him to the bone
no enterprise alas the brand the blow
have humbled him to dust  even hope is gone
he's a base hearted hound  not worth his food
his master cries  he has no gratitude
from deserts wild and many a pathless wood
of savage climes where i have wander'd long
whose hills and streams are yet ungraced by song
i bring illustrious bard this garland rude
the offering though uncouth in kindly mood
thou wilt regard if haply there should be
'mong meaner things the flower simplicity
fresh from coy nature's virgin solitude
accept this frail memorial honour'd scott
of favour'd intercourse in former day
of words of kindness i have ne'er forgot
of acts of friendship i can ne'er repay
for i have found and wherefore say it not
the minstrel's heart as noble as his lay
long years of sorrow and slow wasting care
have stol'n from thy soft cheek its vermeil hue
and somewhat changed the glossy locks that threw
their shadowy beauty round thy temples fair
and lent to those sweet eyes a sadder air
that from their long dark fringes laughing blue
once look'd like violets fresh bathed in dew
and seem'd as they might e'en enchant despair
sickness and grief have touched thee yet so mildly
that though some graces of thy youth are gone
the loveliness that witch'd my heart so wildly
in life's romantic spring  is still thine own
and those meek pensive eyes in their revealings
speak now of higher thoughts and deeper feelings
by heaven directed by the world reviled
amidst the wilderness they sought a home
where beasts of prey and men of murder roam
and untamed nature holds her revels wild
there on their pious toils their master smiled
and prosper'd them unknown or scorn'd of men
till in the satyr's haunt and dragon's den
a garden bloom'd and savage hordes grew mild
so in the guilty heart when heavenly grace
enters it ceaseth not till it uproot
all evil passions from each hidden cell
planting again an eden in their place
which yields to men and angels pleasant fruit
and god himself delighteth there to dwell
he left his christian friends and native strand
by pity for benighted men constrained
his heart was fraught with charity unfeigned
his life was strict his manners meek and bland
long dwelt he lonely in a heathen land
in want and weariness  yet ne'er complained
but laboured that the lost sheep might be gained
nor seeking recompense from human hand
the credit of the arduous works he wrought
was reaped by other men who came behind
the world gave him no honour  none he sought
but cherished christ's example in his mind
to one great aim his heart and hopes were given
to serve his god and gather souls to heaven
time winnows beauty with a fiery wind
driving the dead chaff from the living grain
some day there will be golden sheaves to bind
there will be wonder in the world again
there will be lonely phrases born to power
there will be words immortal and profound
though no man knows the coming of the hour
and no man knows the sower or the ground
it may be even now the ranging earth
lifting to glory some forgotten land
feels there deep beauty quickening to birth
sprung from the sowing of a hidden hand
beauty endures though towering empires die
o speed the blown chaff down the smoking sky
three things there be that prosper up apace
and flourish whilst they grow asunder far
but on a day they meet all in one place
and when they meet they one another mar
and they be these the wood the weed the wag
the wood is that which makes the gallow tree
the weed is that which strings the hangman's bag
the wag my pretty knave betokeneth thee
mark well dear boy whilst these assemble not
green springs the tree hemp grows the wag is wild
but when they meet it makes the timber rot
it frets the halter and it chokes the child
then bless thee and beware and let us pray
we part not with thee at this meeting day
in summer's dreary ear as suns go by
whose yellow beams are dulled with langorous motes
the deep vibrations of the cosmic notes
are as the voice of those that prophesy
her spirit kindles and her filmy eye
in haste the fluttering robe whose glory floats
in pictured folds her eager soul devotes
lo she with her winged harper sweeps the sky
splendours of blossomed time like poppies red
distil dull slumbers o'er the engaged soul
and thrall with sensuous pomp its azured dower
till roused by vibrant touch from the unseen power
the spirit keen freed from the painted dead
on wings mounts up to reach its living goal
the fitful rustle of the sea green leaves
tells of the homeward tide and free blown air
upturns thy gleaming leafage like a share
a silvery foam thy bosom as it heaves
o peasant tree the regal bay doth bare
its throbbing breast to ebbs and floods  and grieves
o slender fronds pale as a moonbeam weaves
joy woke your strain that trembles to despair
willow of normandy say do the birds
of motherland plain in thy sea chant low
or voice of those who brought thee in the ships
to tidal vales of acadie vain words
grief unassuaged makes moan that gaspereau
bore on its flood the fleet with iron lips
dim name yet grand that ever winks serene
in the red fagot's light and like a ghost
hovers above these raucous tides this coast
wreathing weird webs of arrowy salts and keen
under the black blue night's unrolleacuted screen
the loon is calling to the fiery host
and yet no answer comes to keep thy boast
far years their mellow thunders roll between
divinest of the red man's race and name
fullness of hiawatha's dawning day
giver of laws priest prophet all confest
thou'lt come again appeased thy wrath and shame
thy speed in all thy limbs up yonder bay
in white canoe from out the naked west
as hills seem alps when veiled in misty shroud
some men seem kings through mists of ignorance
must we have darkness then and cloud on cloud
to give our hills and pigmy kings a chance
must we conspire to curse the humbling light
lest some one at whose feet our fathers bowed
should suddenly appear full length in sight
scaring to laughter the adoring crowd
oh no god send us light  who loses then
the king of slaves and not the king of men
true kings are kings for ever crowned of god
the king of kings  we need not fear for them
'tis only the usurper's diadem
that shakes at touch of light revealing fraud
god help the man who mortgages his life
for patriot dues henceforward he is safe
no more his noblest virtues only chafe
the hydra that he serves to lust of strife
his self respect his every social tie
all that for which the world's best heroes fight
must be surrendered or unless he die
he is a slave  mayhap a despot slave
like dionysius fearful of the light
or belisarius begging to his grave
through streets o'er which his conquering banners wave
and his reward  to have poor poets sigh
above his dust the requiem of the brave
if homer ne'er had sung if socrates
had never lived in virtue's cause to die
if the wild chorus of the circling seas
had never echoed back poor sappho's sigh
if sparta had not with the purest blood
traced on all time the name thermopylaelig
if greece united through the surging flood
of persian pride had not arisen free
if nought of great or wise or brave or good
had proved thee hellas what thou wast to be
save that thou didst create antigone
thou still had'st in the van of nations stood
fallen are thy noblest temples but above
them all still stands thy shrine of woman's love
out of the ground i rose the seed seemed dead
but lo a slim green arm pushed through the sod
and by and by before my maker god
i stood full ripe a voice cried give us bread
the wind of god went by i bowed my head
and one approached who held a curveacuted knife
and for the life of men he took my life
and ever since by me are millions fed
and then god spake these words o blessed weed
the lowly sister of the lily proud
be thou my chosen messenger to shroud
the mystery of my son the woman's seed
thou dreadest not the sacrificial knife
be thou to dying men the bread of life
the years through which aught that hath life o sun
hath watched or felt thy rising what are they
to those vast aeligons when from night to day
from dawn to dark thy circuit thou didst run
with none to greet thee or regret thee none
to bless thy glowing harbinger of cloud
rose tinted none to sigh when like a shroud
the banner of night proclaimed her victory won
yet through that reign of seeming death so long
to our imperfect ken the marvellous force
which means to ends adjusts in nature's plan
was bringing to the birth that eye of man
which now o sun surveys thy farthest course
a speck amid the countless starry throng
has aught been changed or is there any more
to tell of what the human heart can feel
or is there any phase of woe or weal
that has not been a thousand times before
we live the life our fathers lived of yore
our loves our hates our longings are the same
our creeds have little changed except in name
and our wise books repeat the ancient lore
the men who walked in babylon's proud streets
were just such men as walk our streets today
and the fair maid who blushes as she meets
her lover such as she far far away
long long ago oft has the tale been told
was many a sweet fair maid who lived of old
oh you who love me not tell me some way
whereby i may forget you for a space
nay clean forget you and your lovely face
yet well i know how vain this prayer i pray
all weathers hold you can i make the may
forbid her boughs blow white in every place
or rob june of her rose that comes apace
cheat of their charm the elder months and gray
aye were you dead you could not be forgot
so sparse the bloom along the lanes would be
such sweetness out the briery hedges fled
my tears would fall that you had loved me not
and bitterer tears that you had gone from me
living you break my heart so would you dead
when i consider life and its few years
a wisp of fog betwixt us and the sun
a call to battle and the battle done
ere the last echo dies within our ears
a rose choked in the grass an hour of fears
the gusts that past a darkening shore do beat
the burst of music down an unlistening street
i wonder at the idleness of tears
ye old old dead and ye of yesternight
chieftains and bards and keepers of the sheep
by every cup of sorrow that you had
loose me from tears and make me see aright
how each hath back at once he stayed to weep
homer his sight david his little lad
nor for their beauty do i love the hills
of which i sing  fair though the features seem
bath'd in the splendour of the morning's beam
or clad in that soft witchery that fills
each glen at gloaming not for this the rills
are more to me than any classic stream
that ever poet chose him for a theme
a sweeter reason all my being thrills
they are my own the much lov'd hills of home
not with that earthly ownership which looks
for rent and taxes but because the brooks
the braes the glens all  all  where'er i roam
have voices sounding in the lonely wild
that call me as a mother calls her child
slow fades the sunlight from each lonely hill
and the pale half moon paints with shadowy hue
the sleeping earth how soon doth night renew
watch o'er a world  so passionless so still
so free from all the turbulent thoughts that fill
and thrill the human soul deep hid from view
oh would that we poor tireacuted mortals too
might seek and find repose ah not until
we learn through life to know and understand
the million chords  struck by some unseen hand
on the responsive yearning soul of man
strange and conflicting since the world began
then all of beauty truth and love will find
abiding echo in our heart and mind
it is the precious province of true thought
of the divine creations of the mind
to live unwearied in a heart overwrought
by busy intercourse with town  mankind
poor merchant i whom the dull world's trade wind
blows ever onward on a steady sea
feel oftentimes mid murkiest men refined
by visitants that come alone to me
perchance i class not with the worldly wise
but mine is not the spirit that avoids
mid temporal dealings these communions strange
albeit disgracious to the city's eyes
often i meet rare trinculo at lloyd's
and hamlet sweetly walks with me on 'change
the cold transparent ham is on my fork
it hardly rains  and hark the bell  ding dingle
away three thousand feet at gravel work
mocking a vauxhall shower  married and single
crush  rush  soaked silks with wet white satin mingle
hengler madame round whom all bright sparks lurk
calls audibly on mr and mrs pringle
to study the sublime c  vide burke
all noses are upturned whish ish  on high
the rocket rushes trails just steals in sight
then droops and melts in bubbles of blue light
and darkness reigns  then balls flare up and die
wheels whiz  smack crackers  serpents twist  and then
back to the cold transparent ham again
yet that have hearts vexed with unquiet thought
of worldly grievance and of lost delight
oh turn to spenser's faerie tale  so fraught
with all that's mild and beautiful and bright
there revel in the fancies he hath wroght
fancies more fair than may  or morning light
or solitary star awake at night
or breath from lovers' lips in kisses caught
sweet spenser how i love thy faerie pages
where gentle una lives so radiantly
fair is thy record of romantic ages
and calm and pure the pleasure which it yields
while life and thought are with me  thou shalt be
my dear companion in the silent fields
sorrow hath made thine eyes more dark and keen
and set a whiter hue upon thy cheeks
and round thy pressegraved lips drawn anguish streaks
and made thy forehead fearfully serene
even in thy steady hair her work is seen
for its still parted darkness  till it breaks
in heavy curls upon thy shoulders  speaks
like the stern wave how hard the storm hath been
so looked that hapless lady of the south
sweet isabella at the dreary part
of all the passioned hours of her youth
when her green basil pot by brothers' art
was stolen away so looked her painegraved mouth
in the mute patience of a breaking heart
i stole not your garters dear margaret believe me
to place them around my neck or my knee
they are valueless yet or they do much deceive me
having never been worn and made sacred by thee
of stars and of garters so much has been said
that wit's at a stand on a subject so tried
on the latter what has not been sung to the maid
ere lovers have hung themselves in them and died
may such tragedy doings never wait on your love
but affection all pure and sublime be your lot
so a heaven on earth your existence shall prove
whether fate shall assign you a palace or cot
then love for love only ecstatic you'll barter
and exchange for the ring all the rights of the garter
far from the busy hum of men away
secluded here naught of the world i see
and almost doubt if such a place there be
as london's trading town or paris gay
surcharged with crowds the livelong night and day
that war is going on by land and sea
that slaughter tumult horror and dismay
pervade the world now seemeth strange to me
and as i pass the sweetly lonely hours
estrangeacuted here from bustle strife and care
surrounded but by woods and fields and flowers
while nature's music floats along the air
and autumn all her various bounties pours
i wish an erring world these scenes with me to share
with throb of throstle and with throat of wren
full of soft cheepings comes the longed for may
with myriad murmuring life throughout each day
it grows and greens in grove and field and glen
gleam marigolds across each fragrant fen
the fields grow bright with dandelion gold
the buttercups are yellow on the wold
till all the earth is made glad unto men
and thus may comes most like some sylvan queen
her trailing garments fringed with green and gold
and passes by with shimmer and with sheen
of all her verdure till she reach the fold
that rose crowned june will offer her between
his flower wreathed arms in fragrances untold
take all of me  i am thine own heart soul
brain body  all all that i am or dream
is thine for ever yea though space should teem
with thy conditions i'd fulfil the whole
were to fulfil them to be loved of thee
oh love me  were to love me but a way
to kill me  love me so to die would be
to live for ever let me hear thee say
once only dear i love thee  then all life
would be one sweet remembrance  thou its king
nay thou art that already and the strife
of twenty worlds could not uncrown thee bring
o time my monarch to possess his throne
which is my heart and for himself alone
sometimes when walls seem enemies and sleep
given to others like a cruel jest
sent for my mocking i being mad for rest
creep out all lonely past the huddled sheep
stirring with drowsy tang of bells that keep
soft iterance through the whispery night where nest
and nestling sway by winnowing wind caressed
there fling myself along the grass to weep
sobs gathering hands gripped hard into the earth
the blesseacuted earth that takes us back at last
and think ah could this knowledge now befall
some woman who for long hath thought me worth
only her hatred she would hold me fast
and strive to comfort me forgetting all
a high bare field brown from the plough and borne
aslant from sunset amber wastes of sky
washing the ridge a clamour of crows that fly
in from the wide flats where the spent tides mourn
to yon their rocking roosts in pines wind torn
a line of gray snake fence that zigzags by
a pond and cattle from the homestead nigh
the long deep summonings of the supper horn
black on the ridge against that lonely flush
a cart and stoop necked oxen ranged beside
some barrels and the day worn harvest folk
here emptying their baskets jar the hush
with hollow thunders down the dusk hillside
lumbers the wain and day fades out like smoke
a brown sad coloured hillside where the soil
fresh from the frequent harrow deep and fine
lies bare no break in the remote sky line
save where a flock of pigeons streams aloft
startled from feed in some low lying croft
or far off spires with yellow of sunset shine
and here the sower unwittingly divine
exerts the silent forethought of his toil
alone he treads the glebe his measured stride
dumb in the yielding soil and tho' small joy
dwell in his heavy face as spreads the blind
pale grain from his dispensing palm aside
this plodding churl grows great in his employ
godlike he makes provision for mankind
through the still dusk how sighs the ebb tide out
reluctant for the reed beds down the sands
it washes hark beyond the wan gray strand's
low limits how the winding channels grieve
aware the evasive waters soon will leave
them void amid the waste of desolate lands
where shadowless to the sky the marsh expands
and the noon heats must scar them and the drought
yet soon for them the solacing tide returns
to quench their thirst of longing ah not so
works the stern law our tides of life obey
ebbing in the night watches swift away
scarce known ere fled for ever is the flow
and in parched channel still the shrunk stream mourns
on other fields and other scenes the morn
laughs from her blue  but not such scenes as these
where comes no cheer of summer leaves and bees
and no shade mitigates the day's white scorn
these serious acres vast no groves adorn
but giant trunks bleak shapes that once were trees
tow'r naked unassuaged of rain or breeze
their stern grey isolation grimly borne
the months roll over them and mark no change
but when spring stirs or autumn stills the year
perchance some phantom leafage rustles faint
through their parched dreams  some old time notes ring strange
when in his slender treble far and clear
reiterates the rain bird his complaint
this city is the child of france and spain
that once lived nobly ardent as the heat
in which it came to birth alas how fleet
the years of love and arms there now remain
bleached by the sun and moldered by the rain
impassive fronts that guard some rare retreat
some dim arched salon or some garden sweet
where dreams persist and the past lives again
the braided iron of the balconies
is like locked hands fastidiously set
to bar the world but the proud mysteries
showed me a glamour i may not forget
your face camellia white upon the stair
framed in the midnight thicket of your hair
behind such varioius vesture of strange dreams
abides my soul i know not its true form
nor have i faith it is the thing it seems
now hushed in calm now crying of the storm
forevermore the dreams are as a veil
of strangely wrought enchantment to my ken
wherethrough my soul's eyes make my being quail
or bid me wanton with my joys again
i have no knowledge of the thing it is
whether it be of fiend or angel born
this much i know beloved only this
beneath thy touch of all its power shorn
it yields glad captive to the joy that lies
sweet on thy ruining lips and laughing eyes
when she whose love is even my air of life
enters delay being past to bless my home
and ousts her phantom from its place being come
herself to fill it when the importunate strife
of absence with desire is stilled and rife
with heaven is earth why am i stricken dumb
abashed confounded awed of heart and numb
waking to no triumph of song no welcoming fife
be thine own answer soul who long ago
did'st see the awful light of beauty shine
silent and silently rememberest yet
that glory which no spirit may forget
nor utter save in love a thought too fine
for souls to ignore or mortal sense to know
the sonnet is mechanical in part
and part ideal  the cube root of song
conceive your thought then build the verse along
in true petrarchan style  with rhythmic art
to all the fourteen lines a grace impart
ten syllable the verse the rhymes be strong
within the octave only two belong
and in the sestet three  and here the heart
of all the sonnet lies  concentred fast
your thought developed through each separate line
here breaks the bounds and struggles to be free
through hampering bars of rhyme and when the last
is reached away it soars  abreath divine
in charmegraved flight towards immortality
when i look back upon my childish years
and think how little then i thought at all
sometimes to me it now almost appears
so great the change has been 'twere but a small
increase of change that might transform a man
into a spirit standing at the throne
of god to see in full the mighty plan
divine and know as also he is known
for why should thus so vast a growth have been
which all but tops the verge of earthly skies
if at the end all that a man hath seen
be blotted out before his closing eyes
so were it better still a child to be
and shout young laughter through a world of glee
why should i chafe and fret myself to find
some pebble still untouched upon the beach
where struggling wavelets follow each on each
upon the tide mark of advancing mind
if one with them and urged by those behind
my utmost energy at last should reach
a stone unwetted by a bubble's breach
what gain were it to me or to my kind
though i should fail that further inch to go
some other soon will creep its rugged floor
while resting on the conquered strand below
i calmly watch the rivalry before
rejoicing at the steady onward flow
but at my new found peace rejoicing more
again thou reignest in thy golden hall
rejoicing in thy sway fair queen of night
the ruddy reapers hail thee with delight
theirs is the harvest theirs the joyous call
for tasks well ended ere the season's fall
sweet orb thou smilest from thy starry height
but whilst on them thy beams are shedding bright
to me thou comest overshadowed with a pall
to me alone the year hath fruitless flown
earth hath fulfilled her trust through all her lands
the good man gathereth now where he had sown
and the great master in his vineyard stands
but i as if my task were all unknown
come to his gates alas with empty hands
stay thine overshadowing wings relentless time
nor shed those auburn locks with falling gray
that over my father's frownless forehead play
graceful and fair as in youth's golden prime
stay thy rude hand and he through many a clime
shall teach thee to retrace thy distant way
to the bright regions of historic day
or he shall charm thee with prophetic rhyme
swept from the strings of freedom's holy lyre
or call the muses from the ausonian land
and with the strain their breathing lips inspire
win thy cold ear and check thy ebbing sand
vain is my prayer  already over my sire
thou ruthless power hast stretched thine iron hand
as one who destined from his friends to part
regrets his loss yet hopes again ere while
to share their converse and enjoy their smile
and tempers as he may affliction's dart
thus loved asociates chiefs of elder art
teachers of wisdom who could once beguile
my tedious hours and lighten every toil
i now resign you nor with fainting heart
for pass a few short years or days or hours
and happier seasons may their dawn unfold
and all your sacred fellowship restore
when freed from earth unlimited its powers
mind shall with mind direct communion hold
and kindred spirits meet to part no more
sad soul whom god resuming what he gave
medicines with bitter anguish of the tomb
cease to oppress the portals of the grave
and strain thy aching sight across the gloom
the surged atlantic's winter beaten wave
shall sooner pierce the purpose of the wind
than thy storm tossed and heavy swelling mind
grasp the full import of his means to save
through the dark night lie still god's faithful grace
lies hid like morning underneath the sea
let thy slow hours roll like these weary stars
down to the level ocean patiently
till his loved hand shall touch the eastern bars
and his full glory shine upon thy face
a glorious form thy shining city wore
'mid cypress thickets of perennial green
with minaret and golden dome between
while thy sea softly kiss'd its grassy shore
darting across whose blue expanse was seen
of sculptur'd barques and galleys many a score
whence noise was none save that of plashing oar
nor word was spoke to break the calm serene
unheard is whisker'd boatman's hail or joke
who mute as sinbad's man of copper rows
and only intermits the sturdy stroke
when fearless gull too nigh his pinnace goes
i hardly conscious if i dream'd or woke
mark'd that strange piece of action and repose
i heard old ocean raise her voice and cry
in that still hour between the night and day
i saw the answering tides green robed and gray
turn to her with a low contented sigh
marching with silent feet they passed me by
for the white moon had taught them to obey
and scarce a wavelet broke in fretful spray
as they went forth to kiss the stooping sky
so to my heart when the last sunray sleeps
and the wan night impatient for the moon
throws her gray mantle over land and sea
there comes a call from out life's nether deeps
and tides like some old ocean in a swoon
flow out in soundless majesty to thee
becalmed upon the equatorial seas
a ship of gold lay on a sea of fire
each sail and rope and spar as in desire
mutely besought the kisses of a breeze
low laughter told the mariners at ease
sweet sea songs hymned the red sun's fun'ral pyre
yet one with eyes that never seemed to tire
watched for the storm nursed on the thunder's knees
thou watcher of the spirit's inner keep
scanning death's lone illimitable deep
spread outward to the far immortal shore
while the vault sleeps from the upheaving deck
thou see'st the adamantine reefs that wreck
and life's low shoals where lusting billows roar
when with low moanings on the distant shore
like vain regrets the ocean tide is rolled
when thro' bare boughs the tale of death is told
by breezes sighing summer days are o'er
when all the days we loved    the days of yore
lie in their vaults dead kings who ruled of old
unrobed and sceptreless uncrowned with gold
conquered and to be crowned ah never more
if o'er the bare fields cold and whitening
with the first snow flakes i should see thy form
and meet and kiss thee that were enough of spring
enough of sunshine could i feel the warm
glad beating of thy heart 'neath winter's wing
tho' earth were full of whirlwind and of storm
sonnets are full of love and this my tome
has many sonnets so here now shall be
one sonnet more a love sonnet from me
to her whose heart is my heart's quiet home
to my first love my mother on whose knee
i learnt love lore that is not troublesome
whose service is my special dignity
and she my loadstar while i go and come
and so because you love me and because
i love you mother i have woven a wreath
of rhymes wherewith to crown your honored name
in you not fourscore years can dim the flame
of love whose blessed glow transcends the laws
of time and change and mortal life and death
remember me when i am gone away
gone far away into the silent land
when you can no more hold me by the hand
nor i half turn to go yet turning stay
remember me when no more day by day
you tell me of our future that you plann'd
only remember me you understand
it will be late to counsel then or pray
yet if you should forget me for a while
and afterwards remember do not grieve
for if the darkness and corruption leave
a vestige of the thoughts that once i had
better by far you should forget and smile
than that you should remember and be sad
a sonnet is a moment's monument
memorial from the soul's eternity
to one dead deathless hour look that it be
whether for lustral rite or dire portent
of its own arduous fulness reverent
carve it in ivory or in ebony
as day or night may rule and let time see
its flowering crest impearled and orient
a sonnet is a coin its face reveals
the soul  its converse to what power 'tis due
whether for tribute to the august appeals
of life or dower in love's high retinue
it serve or 'mid the dark wharf's cavernous breath
in charon's palm it pay the toll to death
what smouldering senses in death's sick delay
or seizure of malign vicissitude
can rob this body of honour or denude
this soul of wedding raiment worn to day
for lo even now my lady's lips did play
with these my lips such consonant interlude
as laurelled orpheus longed for when he wooed
the half drawn hungering face with that last lay
i was a child beneath her touch  a man
when breast to breast we clung even i and she
a spirit when her spirit looked through me
a god when all our life breath met to fan
our life blood till love's emulous ardours ran
fire within fire desire in deity
at length their long kiss severed with sweet smart
and as the last slow sudden drops are shed
from sparkling eaves when all the storm has fled
so singly flagged the pulses of each heart
their bosoms sundered with the opening start
of married flowers to either side outspread
from the knit stem yet still their mouths burnt red
fawned on each other where they lay apart
sleep sank them lower than the tide of dreams
and their dreams watched them sink and slid away
slowly their souls swam up again through gleams
of watered light and dull drowned waifs of day
till from some wonder of new woods and streams
he woke and wondered more for there she lay
your hands lie open in the long fresh grass
the finger points look through like rosy blooms
your eyes smile peace the pasture gleams and glooms
'neath billowing skies that scatter and amass
all round our nest far as the eye can pass
are golden kingcup fields with silver edge
where the cow parsley skirts the hawthorn hedge
'tis visible silence still as the hour glass
deep in the sun searched growths the dragon fly
hangs like a blue thread loosened from the sky
so this wing'd hour is dropt to us from above
oh clasp we to our hearts for deathless dower
this close companioned inarticulate hour
when twofold silence was the song of love
look in my face my name is might have been
i am also called no more too late farewell
unto thine ear i hold the dead sea shell
cast up thy life's foam fretted feet between
unto thine eyes the glass where that is seen
which had life's form and love's but by my spell
is now a shaken shadow intolerable
of ultimate things unuttered the frail screen
mark me how still i am i but should there dart
one moment through thy soul the soft surprise
of that winged peace which lulls the breath of sighs
then shalt thou see me smile and turn apart
thy visage to mine ambush at thy heart
sleepless with cold commemorative eyes
water for anguish of the solstice  nay
but dip the vessel slowly  nay but lean
and hark how at its verge the wave sighs in
reluctant  hush beyond all depth away
the heat lies silent at the brink of day
now the hand trails upon the viol string
that sobs and the brown faces cease to sing
sad with the whole of pleasure  whither stray
her eyes now from whose mouth the slim pipes creep
and leave it pouting while the shadowed grass
is cool against her naked side  let be
say nothing now unto her lest she weep
nor name this ever  be it as it was
life touching lips with immortality
mary rose up as one in sleep might rise
and went to meet her brother's friend and they
who tarried with her said she goes to pray
and weep where her dead brother's body lies
so with their wringing of hands and with sighs
they stood before him in the public way
had'st thou been with him lord upon that day
he had not died she said drooping her eyes
mary and martha with bowed faces kept
holding his garments one on each side  where
have ye laid him he asked lord come and see
the sound of grieving voices heavily
and universally was round him there
a sound that smote his spirit jesus wept
too long alas through life's tempestuous tide
heedless of heaven my giddy course i steered
linked with the scoffing crew nor aught revered
great nature's god such erring dreams belied
my fancy swollen with unsubstantial pride
while uglier far than have been feigned or feared
ten thousand phantoms to my sight appeared
and drew me darkling far from truth aside
but vigorous now with eagle ken restored
by nobler means aiming at nobler ends
to the mild bosom of its saving lord
elate with ardent hope my soul ascends
while over the dreadful gulf yet unexplored
religion's golden sun its evening beam extends
ingenious insect but of ruthless mould
whose savage craft as nature taught designs
a mazy web of death the filmy lines
that form thy circling labyrinth enfold
each thoughtless fly that wanders near the hold
sad victim of thy guile nor aught avail
his silken wings nor coat of glossy mail
nor varying hues of azure jet or gold
yet though thus ill the fluttering captive fares
whom heedless of the fraud thy toils trepan
thy tyrant fang that slays the stranger spares
the bloody brothers of thy cruel clan
while man against his fellows spreads his snares
then most delighted when his prey is man
my heart a haunted manor is where time
has fumbled noiselessly with mouldering hands
at sunset ghosts troop out in sudden bands
at noon 'tis vacant as a house of crime
but when unseen as sound the night winds climb
the higher keys with their unstilled demands
it wakes to memories of other lands
and thrills with echoes of enchanted rhyme
then through the dreams and hopes of earlier years
a fall of phantom footsteps on the stair
approaches near and ever nearer yet
a voice rings through my life's deserted ways
i turn to greet thee love the empty air
holds but the spectre of my own regret
my footsteps press where centuries ago
the red men fought and conquered lost and won
whole tribes and races gone like last year's snow
have found the eternal hunting grounds and run
the fiery gauntlet of their active days
till few are left to tell the mournful tale
and these inspire us with such wild amaze
they seem like spectres passing down a vale
steeped in uncertain moonlight on their way
towards some bourn where darkness blinds the day
and night is wrapped in mystery profound
we cannot lift the mantle of the past
we seem to wander over hallowed ground
we scan the trail of thought but all is overcast
there was a time  and that is all we know
no record lives of their ensanguined deeds
the past seems palsied with some giant blow
and grows the more obscure on what it feeds
a rotted fragment of a human leaf
a few stray skulls a heap of human bones
these are the records  the traditions brief
'twere easier far to read the speechless stones
the fierce ojibwas with tornado force
striking white terror to the hearts of braves
the mighty hurons rolling on their course
compact and steady as the ocean waves
the stately chippewas a warrior host
who were they  whence  and why no human tongue can boast
there is no sadness here oh that my heart
were calm and peaceful as these dreamy groves
that all my hopes and passions and deep loves
could sit in such an atmosphere of peace
where no unholy impulses would start
responsive to the throes that never cease
to keep my spirit in such wild unrest
'tis only in the struggling human breast
that the true sorrow lives our fruitful joys
have stony kernels hidden in their core
life in a myriad phases passeth here
and death as various  an equal poise
yet all is but a solemn change  no more
and not a sound save joy pervades the atmosphere
i sought on earth a garden of delight
or island altar to the sea and air
where gentle music were accounted prayer
and reason veiled performed the happy rite
my sad youth worshipped at the piteous height
where god vouchsafed the death of man to share
his love made mortal sorrow light to bear
but his deep wounds put joy to shamegraved flight
and though his arms outstretched upon the tree
were beautiful and pleaded my embrace
my sins were loth to look upon his face
so came i down from golgotha to thee
eternal mother let the sun and sea
heal me and keep me in thy dwelling place
slow and reluctant was the long descent
with many farewell pious looks behind
and dumb misgivings where the path might wind
and questionings of nature as i went
the greener branches that above me bent
the broadening valleys quieted my mind
to the fair reasons of the spring inclined
and to the summer's tender argument
but sometimes as revolving night descended
and in my childish heart the new song ended
i lay down full of longing on the steep
and haunting still the lonely way i wended
into my dreams the ancient sorrow blended
and with these holy echoes charmed my sleep
o world thou choosest not the better part
it is not wisdom to be only wise
and on the inward vision close the eyes
but it is wisdom to believe the heart
columbus found a world and had no chart
save one that faith deciphered in the skies
to trust the soul's invincible surmise
was all his science and his only art
our knowledge is a torch of smoky pine
that lights the pathway but one step ahead
across a void of mystery and dread
bid then the tender light of faith to shine
by which alone the mortal heart is led
unto the thinking of the thought divine
i would i had been born in nature's day
when man was in the world a wide eyed boy
and clouds of sorrow crossed his sky of joy
to scatter dewdrops on the buds of may
then could he work and love and fight and pray
nor heartsick grow in fortune's long employ
mighty to build and ruthless to destroy
he lived while maskegraved death unquestioned lay
now ponder we the ruins of the years
and groan beneath the weight of boasted gain
no unsung bacchanal can charm our ears
and lead our dances to the woodland fane
no hope of heaven sweeten our few tears
and hush the importunity of pain
dreamt i to day the dream of yesternight
sleep ever feigning one evolving theme
of my two lives which should i call the dream
which action vanity which vision sight
some greater waking must pronounce aright
if aught abideth of the things that seem
and with both currents swell the flooded stream
into an ocean infinite of light
even such a dream i dream and know full well
my waking passeth like a midnight spell
but know not if my dreaming breaketh through
into the deeps of heaven and of hell
i know but this of all i would i knew
truth is a dream unless my dream is true
love not as do the flesh imprisoned men
whose dreams are of a bitter bought caress
or even of a maiden's tenderness
whom they love only that she loves again
for it is but thyself thou lovest then
or what thy thoughts would glory to possess
but love thou nothing thou wouldst love the less
if henceforth ever hidden from thy ken
love but the formless and eternal whole
from whose effulgence one unheeded ray
breaks on this prism of dissolving clay
into the flickering colours of thy soul
these flash and vanish bid them not to stay
for wisdom brightens as they fade away
i would i might forget that i am i
and break the heavy chain that binds me fast
whose links about myself my deeds have cast
what in the body's tomb doth buried lie
is boundless 'tis the spirit of the sky
lord of the future guardian of the past
and soon must forth to know his own at last
in his large life to live i fain would die
happy the dumb beast hungering for food
but calling not his suffering his own
blessegraved the angel gazing on all good
but knowing not he sits upon a throne
wretched the mortal pondering his mood
and doomed to know his aching heart alone
o martyred spirit of this helpless whole
who dost by pain for tyranny atone
and in the star the atom and the stone
purgest the primal guilt and in the soul
rich but in grief thou dost thy wealth unroll
and givest of thy substance to thine own
mingling the love the laughter and the groan
in the large hollow of the heaven's bowl
fill full my cup the dregs and honeyed brim
i take from thy just hand more worthy love
for sweetening not the draught for me or him
what in myself i am that let me prove
relent not for my feeble prayer nor dim
the burning of thine altar for my hymn
have patience it is fit that in this wise
the spirit purge away its proper dross
no endless fever doth thy watches toss
for by excess of evil evil dies
soon shall the faint world melt before thine eyes
and all life's losses cancelled by life's loss
thou shalt lay down all burdens on thy cross
and be that day with god in paradise
have patience for a long eternity
no summons woke thee from thy happy sleep
for love of god one vigil thou canst keep
and add thy drop of sorrow to the sea
having known grief all will be well with thee
ay and thy second slumber will be deep
have i the heart to wander on the earth
so patient in her everlasting course
seeking no prize but bowing to the force
that gives direction and hath given birth
rain tears sweet pity to refresh my dearth
and plough my sterile bosom sharp remorse
that i grow sick and curse my being's source
if haply one day passes lacking mirth
doth the sun therefore burn that i may bask
or do the tireegraved earth and tireless sea
that toil not for their pleasure toil for me
amid the world's long striving wherefore ask
what reasons were or what rewards shall be
the covenant god gave us is a task
deem not because you see me in the press
of this world's children run my fated race
that i blaspheme against a proffered grace
or leave unlearned the love of holiness
i honour not that sanctity the less
whose aureole illumines not my face
but dare not tread the secret holy place
to which the priest and prophet have access
for some are born to be beatified
by anguish and by grievous penance done
and some to furnish forth the age's pride
and to be praised of men beneath the sun
and some are born to stand perplexed aside
from so much sorrow  of whom i am one
mightier storms than this are brewed on earth
that pricks the crystal lake with summer showers
the past hath treasure of sublimer hours
and god is witness to their changeless worth
big is the future with portentous birth
of battles numberless and nature's powers
outdo my dreams of beauty in the flowers
and top my revels with the demons' mirth
but thou glad river that hast reached the plain
scarce wak'st the rushes to a slumberous sigh
the mountains sleep behind thee and the main
awaits thee lulling an eternal pain
with patience nor doth phoebe throned on high
the mirror of thy placid heart disdain
sweet are the days we wander with no hope
along life's labyrinthine trodden way
with no impatience at the steep's delay
nor sorrow at the swift descended slope
why this inane curiosity to grope
in the dim dust for gems' unmeaning ray
why this proud piety that dares to pray
for a world wider than the heaven's cope
farewell my burden no more will i bear
the foolish load of my fond faith's despair
but trip the idle race with careless feet
the crown of olive let another wear
it is my crown to mock the runner's heat
with gentle wonder and with laughter sweet
there may be chaos still around the world
this little world that in my thinking lies
for mine own bosom is the paradise
where all my life's fair visions are unfurled
within my nature's shell i slumber curled
unmindful of the changing outer skies
where now perchance some new born eros flies
or some old cronos from his throne is hurled
i heed them not or if the subtle night
haunt me with deities i never saw
i soon mine eyelid's drowsy curtain draw
to hide their myriad faces from my sight
they threat in vain the whirlwind cannot awe
a happy snow flake dancing in the flaw
a wall a wall to hem the azure sphere
and hedge me in from the disconsolate hills
give me but one of all the mountain rills
enough of ocean in its voice i hear
come no profane insatiate mortal near
with the contagion of his passionate ills
the smoke of battle all the valleys fills
let the eternal sunlight greet me here
this spot is sacred to the deeper soul
and to the piety that mocks no more
in nature's inmost heart is no uproar
none in this shrine in peace the heavens roll
in peace the slow tides pulse from shore to shore
and ancient quiet broods from pole to pole
a thousand beauties that have never been
haunt me with hope and tempt me to pursue
the gods methinks dwell just behind the blue
the satyrs at my coming fled the green
the flitting shadows of the grove between
the dryads' eyes were winking and i knew
the wings of sacred eros as he flew
and left me to the love of things not seen
'tis a sad love like an eternal prayer
and knows no keen delight no faint surcease
yet from the seasons hath the earth increase
and heaven shines as if the gods were there
had dian passed there could no deeper peace
embalm the purple stretches of the air
there was a time when in the teeth of fate
i flung the challenge of the spirit's right
the child the dreamer of that visioned night
woke and was humbled unto man's estate
a slave i am on sun and moon i wait
who heed not that i live upon their light
me they despise but are themselves so bright
they flood my heart with love and quench my hate
o subtle beauty sweet persuasive worth
that didst the love of being first inspire
we do thee homage both in death and birth
thirsting for thee we die in thy great dearth
or borrow breath of infinite desire
to chase thine image through the haunted earth
blaspheme not love ye lovers nor dispraise
the wise divinity that makes you blind
sealing the eyes but showing to the mind
the high perfection from which nature strays
for love is god and in unfathomed ways
brings forth the beauty for which fancy pined
i loved and lost my love among mankind
but i have found it after many days
oh trust in god and banish rash despair
that feigning evil is itself the curse
my angel is come back more sad and fair
and witness to the truth of love i bear
with too much rapture for this sacred verse
at the exceeding answer to my prayer
above the battlements of heaven rise
the glittering domes of the gods' golden dwelling
whence like a constellation passion quelling
the truth of all things feeds immortal eyes
there all forgotten dreams of paradise
from the deep caves of memory upwelling
all tender joys beyond our dim foretelling
are ever bright beneath the flooded skies
there we live o'er amid angelic powers
our lives without remorse as if not ours
and others' lives with love as if our own
for we behold from those eternal towers
the deathless beauty of all wingegraved hours
and have our being in their truth alone
these strewn thoughts by the mountain pathway sprung
i conned for comfort till i ceased to grieve
and with these flowering thorns i dare to weave
the crown great mother on thine altar hung
teach thou a larger speech to my loosed tongue
and to mine opened eyes thy secrets give
that in thy perfect love i learn to live
and in thine immortality be young
the soul is not on earth an alien thing
that hath her life's rich sources otherwhere
she is a parcel of the sacred air
she takes her being from the breath of spring
the glance of phoebus is her fount of light
and her long sleep a draught of primal night
oh for one draught of cooling northern air
that it might pour its freshness on me now
that it might kiss my cheek and cleave my hair
and part its currents round my fevered brow
ocean and sky and earth a blistering calm
spread over all how weary wears the day
oh lift the wave and bend the distant palm
breeze wheresoe'er thy lagging pinions stray
triumphant burst upon the level deep
rock the fixed hull and swell the clinging sail
arouse the opal clouds that o'er us sleep
sound thy shrill whistle we will bid thee hail
though wrapped in all the storm clouds of the north
yet from thy home of ice come forth o breeze come forth
he spoke to us of egypt in her prime
he showed us pictures of the rock hewn kings
and memnon's hoary bulk that no more sings
his greeting to the morning sun the time
slipped back through thirty centuries dim with rime
and mist that veils the dawn of human things
until we felt the awe the great past brings
to us who dwell in this unstoried clime
and then he paused and turned the night was torn
with flying clouds but once there gleamed a star
a single sun of all the heavenly band
and he lo that dim light saw egypt born
before it all earth's ages moments are
and all her greatness but a grain of sand
a maiden with a garland on her head
sat in her bower between two lovers one
wore such a wreath as hers the other none
but him in merry wise she garlanded
with that she wore then gaily took instead
the other's wreath and wore it as her own
whereat both smiled each deeming she had shown
himself the favourite though she nothing said
concerning this by any spoken word
yet by her act methinks the maid preferred
the lover she discrowned a friendly thing
or whimsical  no more  the gift she gave
a queen might do as much by any slave
but he whose crown she wore was her heart's king
that i adore thee my most gracious queen
more in my spirit than my body's sense
of thine were such incredible pretence
as i would scorn to utter thou hast seen
when eyes and lips responsive to the heart
were bent in worship of thy lips and eyes
until o bliss each pleasure pulsing part
hath found its fellow in love's sweet emprise
each answering other in such eager wise
as they would never cease to kiss and cling
ah then meseemed amid the storm of sighs
i heard thy voice exclaiming o my king
so may my soul be ever true to thine
as with thy body thou dost worship mine
into the crystal chalice of the soul
is falling drop by drop life's blending mead
the pleasant waters of our childhood speed
and enter first and love pours in its whole
deep flood of tenderness and gall there roll
the drops of sweet and bitter that proceed
from wedded trustfulness and hearts that bleed
for children that outrun us to the goal
and later come the calmer joys of age
the restful streams of quietude that flow
around their fading lives whose heritage
is whitened locks and voice serene and low
these added blessings round the vessel up
death is the overflowing of the cup
the world is locked in sleep with perfect night
gazing from out my window i behold
the moon a burnished bowl of gleaming gold
hung in mid sky with azure wine brimmed bright
the sentinel church spire lifts its stately height
and where the vane upon its crest is bold
a single wanderer from the starry fold
shines cold and spectral with its twinkling light
white are the roofs in crystal garments all
unheard the murmuring streamlet's rhythmic flow
weird shapes upon the spotless waste of snow
the tree trunks stand where their gaunt shadows fall
blest hour of rest  gift of a hand divine
what quiet peace tranquillity are thine
at noon of night the goddess silver stoled
came with light foot across the moonlit land
and breezes soft as blow o'er samarcand
stirred her free hair that glinted like clear gold
sweet were her smiling lips as when of old
vertumnus wooed her on the grassy strand
of some swift tuscan river overspanned
by sunny skies that knew no breath of cold
so when the door of dawn grew aureate
and broken was the dim night's peaceful hush
by harvesters uprisen to greet the morn
they knew pomona had passed by in state
for on the apples was a rosier blush
and on the grapes a richer lustre born
behold a billowy sea of golden spears
that to and fro in every breeze that blows
tosses its amber waves and proudly shows
bright scarlet poppies when the warm wind veers
hearken and lo there falls upon the ears
a song as mellow as the one that rose
from boaz's fields at daytime's drowsy close
and thrilled his heart in those dim hebrew years
and the swart mower leaning on his scythe
to catch the swelling music clear and blythe
thinks as his eyes with love light brim and glow
that she who sings the while the bright beams fade
is far diviner than the lovely maid
who gleaned in fields judaean long ago
a triton drowsy as the god of sleep
from horn uplifted pours a limpid stream
athwart whose falling drops the sunbeams gleam
through waving boughs that span the crystal deep
from brooding branches bright eyed nestlings peep
the merry sylvan choirs are hushed in dream
and all the voices of the mid day seem
within some slumbering warder's wakeless keep
into a shadowy moss rimmed pool like this
musing of dead delight and longed for bliss
the while the murmurous water lapped the shore
alluring nymphs with smiles and amorous breath
drew the young hylas down to meet his death
amid the silvery reeds that noon of yore
as perfect in their symmetry as thine
o inarticulate marble lips were those
my love once raised to mine yet tinged with rose
and freighted with a redolence divine
her poise of head was queenly fair and fine
her alabaster arms that shamed the snows
her gracious bearing had thy pure repose
and stately was she as the forest pine
knowledge sat throned upon her regal brow
round which her tresses rippled bright as gold
sweet as a songbird's on a budding bough
the liquid voice that from her lips outrolled
but lo there came an awful change and now
thou in thine icy hush art not more cold
renowned britannia loved parental land
regard thy welfare with a watchful eye
whenever the weight of want's afflicting hand
wakes in thy vales the poor's persuasive cry
when wealth enormous sets the oppressor high
when bribes thy ductile senators command
and slaves in office freemen's rights withstand
then mourn for then thy fate approacheth nigh
not from perfidious gaul or haughty spain
nor all the neighbouring nations of the main
though leagued in war tremendous round thy shore
but from thyself thy ruin must proceed
nor boast thy power for know it is decreed
thy freedom lost thy power shall be no more
i saw time in his workshop carving faces
scattered around his tools lay blunting griefs
sharp cares that cut out deeply in reliefs
of light and shade sorrows that smooth the traces
of what were smiles nor yet without fresh graces
his handiwork for ofttimes rough were ground
and polished oft the pinched made smooth and round
the calm look too the impetuous fire replaces
long time i stood and watched with hideous grin
he took each heedless face between his knees
and graved and scarred and bleached with boiling tears
i wondering turned to go when lo my skin
feels crumpled and in glass my own face sees
itself all changed scarred careworn white with years
o little hands long vanished in the night
sweet fairy hands that were my treasure here
my heart is full of music from some sphere
where ye make melody for god's delight
though autumn clouds obscure the starry height
and winds are noisy and the land is drear
in this blank room i feel my lost love near
and hear you playing  hands so small and white
the shadowy organ sings its songs again
the dead years turn to music at its voice
and all the dreams come back my brain did store
once more dear hands ye soothe me in my pain
once more your music makes my heart rejoice
god speed the day we clasp for evermore
these mountains reign alone they do not share
the transitory life of woods and streams
wrapt in the deep solemnity of dreams
they drain the sunshine of the upper air
beneath their peaks the huge clouds here and there
take counsel of the wind which all night screams
through grey burnt forests where the moonlight beams
on hidden lakes and rocks worn smooth and bare
these mountains once throned in some primal sea
shook half the world with thunder and the sun
pierced not the gloom that clung about their crest
now with sealed lips toilers from toil set free
unvexed by fate the part they played being done
they watch and wait in venerable rest
how many a throb of the young poet heart
aspiring to the ideal bliss of fame
deems that time soon may sanctify his claim
among the sons of song to dwell apart
time passes  passes the aspiring flame
of hope shrinks down the white flower poesy
breaks on its stalk and from its earth turned eye
drop sleepy tears instead of that sweet dew
rich with inspiring odors insect wings
drew from its leaves with every changing sky
while its young innocent petals unsunned grew
no more in pride to other ears he sings
but with a dying charm himself unto
for a sad season then to active life he springs
methought i saw an angel on the sun
sit throneacuted whilst around the planets swayed
each with its guiding spirit that obeyed
in duteous wise that lofty visaged one
but on this earth it seemed two spirits fought
a deadly combat struggling hand to hand
the good and evil over sea and land
locked in a strife with dreadful issues fraught
for as the calm eyed ruler of each sphere
bore slowly past the battle riven world
firm in his mighty hand he held a spear
poised o'er his head and ready to be hurled
to dash this globe to fragments as it whirled
should evil's brow the wreath of victory wear
i leant my breast against the golden gate
that bars the body from the land of dreams
but lets the soul to roam in lawns where wait
or wander down the banks of shining streams
the dead and living holding strange debate
of things that yet should happen 'neath the beams
of suns as yet unrisen whilst listless fate
paused and the stars unyoked their tired teams
and as my hand the latch sought for i fain
had followed one who bore a white rose wreath
sleep touched mine eyes with darkness and the pain
of longing ceased and when i next drew breath
i heard a voice low whisper it is vain
to enter here  thou first must drink of death
a land of deathful sleep where fitful dreams
of hurrying spring scarce wake swift fading flowers
a land of fleckless sky and sheer shed beams
of sun and stars through day's and dark's slow hours
a land where sand has choked once fluent streams
where grassless plains lie girt by granite towers
that fright the swift and heaven nurtured teams
of winds that bear afar the sea gleaned showers
the wild atlantic fretted by the breath
of fiery gales o'er leagues of desert sped
rolls back and wreaks in surf its thunderous wrath
on rocks that down the wan wide shore are spread
the waves for ever roar a song of death
the shore they roar to is for ever dead
talk not of prayers that fail the prayers unheard
are not the askings paul meant when he said
pray without ceasing be thou well assured
the true petition not of barren word
but plumed of deed scales heaven overhead
where souls and suns from god's high throne are shed
pray without ceasing let good deeds unfold
like petals of a rose until complete
the flower of asking full and fair and sweet
is fit for god's right hand to take and hold
false prayers are barren breath like vapour rolled
between men and the stars they hide the feet
of angels but the true prayer wise and meet
from chiming sphere to sphere on high is told
a mountain sometimes stands in silent state
and outward stillness whilst its fiery heart
throbs with doom's potency and pent up fate
so kant stood brooding for twelve years apart
from men whilst his strong soul did dominate
amid the shades whose realm was its resort
then on the mind's illimitable sea
he sailed undaunted till he found an isle
where truth sat like a sybil 'neath a tree
whose fruit was knowledge and he felt her smile
smite on the veils of sense that utterly
cloud the soul's eyes and so sad men beguile
and in his trembling hand she laid the key
that solves the secrets of all things that be
how often is it that our onward path
divides in twain whilst at the junction stand
two fates and each a garland proffereth
of buds of promise twined with outstretched hand
the one is duty called her visage hath
the clearer light and of her promised land
she tells high tidings whilst with stern command
she points to roads that lead perchance to death
the other is more beautiful her face
glows in the sunlight and her lovelit eyes
shew in their limpid wells the deeps of space
star strewn with hopes and fairest prophecies
her name is inclination but no peace
dwells in her smile nor on her pathway lies
oft would my soul sing but the heart her lyre
tear wet and warped by mine and other's woe
lies in the dust unstrung whilst flicker slow
the embers of its faint and fading fire
so here i sit and watch the moments flow
as into past times' realm the years retire
with scant gleaned grain within my hands to show
scant grain of deed or song my soul's desire
if now god's messenger pale death should ask
what good hast thou to show for these thy years
hast thou made thy life real or but a masque
what answer could i give of which one task
by grace whereof men's smiles were lit or tears
dried could i say my scroll the record bears
to all men nature speaketh in this wise
read in my book or straightway shall ye die
its leaves are open to the readers' eyes
its living lore was thought and written by
the god whose truths to you are mysteries
and in whose hollow hand alike we lie
read in my book and in your reading live
i ask ye many questions day by day
to those that answer rightly i will give
a guerdon rich and full if one shall say
alas i know not i may not reprieve
if one shall answer wrongly i must slay
i know not mercy and may not forgive
and none can my strong mandate disobey
when i behold the pearl encinctured moon
gaze on the night with seeming ardour warm
and mark on hill and dale her soft smiles strewn
till darkness dies before her white wand's charm
i feel that what to earth so fair is shewn
is false and fleeting as her changing form
for in her heart is death and on her breast
she bears the impress of her life's decay
and that sweet light wherewith her throne is drest
is but the reflex of the quick'ning ray
lent by the sun that fain would see her blest
with living verdure filling every grey
dead plain and formless mountain's arid crest
yet cold and dead she wends through night and day
love came to me full oft and shwed his face
and smiled and fled love whispered in the spring
called from his far off secret dwelling place
and oft before mine eyes his gleaming wing
fluttered an instant oft so high he sate
on peaks of snow that all my breath was gone
before i reached him and dispassionate
desire lay dead and love of love alone
my heart held yet when love did farthest seem
he silent stood beside me and his form
was veiled then as awaking from a dream
i knew him suddenly and as the storm
shrouding the sun may break and disappear
the veil was rent and lo himself was here
the sea is as a garden that the wind
biddeth break forth in lily buds the sky
a picture with all fairyland designed
by day the clouds by night the stars sweep by
nor question nor reveal love's horoscope
life is a maiden with a garland crowned
space is a palace built by hands of hope
time is a melody that doth resound
from star to distant star and only heard
in passing on its transit from afar
death the inevitable is deferred
to such most distant futures that his car
whose thundering wheels so often sound a nigh
is silent as his shadow passing by
is love then happiness ah yes the best
is he not pain oh bitter doth he smile
as smiles the morning doth he weep yea lest
his smile might lose its savour hath he guile
as hath the red rose that beguiles the bee
what doth his voice discourse of lo herein
lieth love's potency his keen eyes see
and smite upon each secret hoarded sin
and then he saith whilst this with thee doth dwell
must thou and i for ever be at strife
and in thine ear my tongue must hourly tell
dispraise till thou dost cast it from thy life
and most he raileth at the darling vice
that doth each soul so cunningly entice
be thou the bow and like the arrow i
will cleave the golden apple of endeavour
the errant knight of truth i'll slay each lie
and error's web with thought's keen sword blade sever
the earth is but a clod until the sun
draw beauty from its breast in tree and flower
the years are but a waste of sands that run
till high achievement crown one noble hour
the great word's rocky ribs are thinly veined
with gold that none but strongest seekers' find
and many a combat by the warrior gained
before his brow with bays may be entwined
alone my spirit faints upon the way
be thou its guide be thou its saving stay
the night is still the silent frost hangs thick
on leaf and grass the jewel's coming day
will light to softened splendour bright and quick
the starbeams through the crisp air thrill away
swifter than these a thought has southward sped
and back returned on faithful homing wing
bearing the picture of a golden head
pressed on a snowy pillow slumbering
my darling lies each eyelid silken fringed
droops like a dove's breast feather tremulously
the lips a petalled casket half unhinged
show pearls more bright than holds the silver sea
for now a stray dream spirit at her ear
tells to the child some tale she smiles to hear
a rosebud mouth sealed fount of words unspoken
thy kiss is as a sacrament soft hands
that hold my heart each dimple is a token
of conquest o'er the future's widening lands
bright smile that from the sundawn seems to borrow
its rarest light i dare not even pray
that thou escape the shades of pain and sorrow
for flowers fade in every cloudless day
but when the storm comes mayst thou find sure haven
or strength to stand until its rage hath past
and in the dark may god's strong help be given
though long the night the day must come at last
and if my own death first be not decreed
oh may my breast thy shield be at thy need
down the strait vistas where a city street
fades in pale dust and vaporous distances
stained with far fumes the light grows less and less
and the sky reddens round the day's retreat
now out of orient chambers cool and sweet
like nature's pure lustration dusk comes down
now the lamps brighten and the quickening town
rings with the trample of returning feet
and pleasure risen from her own warm mould
sunk all the drowsy and unloved daylight
in layers of odorous softness paphian girls
cover with gauze with satin and with pearls
crown and about her spangly vestments fold
the ermine of the empire of the night
her courts are by the flux of flaming ways
between the rivers and the illumined sky
whose fervid depths reverberate from on high
fierce lustres mingled in a fiery haze
they mark it inland blithe and fair of face
her suitors follow guessing by the glare
beyond the hilltops in the evening air
how bright the cressets at her portals blaze
on the pure fronts defeat ere many a day
falls like the soot and dirt on city snow
there hopes deferred lie sunk in piteous seams
her paths are disillusion and decay
with ruins piled and unapparent woe
the graves of beauty and the wreck of dreams
there was a youth around whose early way
white angels hung in converse and sweet choir
teaching in summer clouds his thought to stray
in cloud and far horizon to desire
his life was nursed in beauty like the stream
born of clear showers and the mountain dew
close under snow clad summits where they gleam
forever pure against heaven's orient blue
within the city's shades he walked at last
faint and more faint in sad recessional
down the dim corridors of time outworn
a chorus ebbed from that forsaken past
a hymn of glories fled beyond recall
with the lost heights and splendor of life's morn
up at his attic sill the south wind came
and days of sun and storm but never peace
along the town's tumultuous arteries
he heard the heart throbs of a sentient frame
each night the whistles in the bay the same
whirl of incessant wheels and clanging cars
for smoke that half obscured the circling stars
burnt like his youth with but a sickly flame
up to his attic came the city cries
the throes with which her iron sinews heave
and yet forever behind prison doors
welled in his heart and trembled in his eyes
the light that hangs on desert hills at eve
and tints the sea on solitary shores
a tide of beauty with returning may
floods the fair city from warm pavements fume
odors endeared down avenues in bloom
the chestnut trees with phallic spires are gay
over the terrace flows the thronged cafe
the boulevards are streams of hurrying sound
and through the streets like veins when they abound
the lust for pleasure throbs itself away
here let me live here let me still pursue
phantoms of bliss that beckon and recede
thy strange allurements city that i love
maze of romance where i have followed too
the dream youth treasures of its dearest need
and stars beyond thy towers bring tidings of
give me the treble of thy horns and hoofs
the ponderous undertones of 'bus and tram
a garret and a glimpse across the roofs
of clouds blown eastward over notre dame
the glad eyed streets and radiant gatherings
where i drank deep the bliss of being young
the strife and sweet potential flux of things
i sought youth's dream of happiness among
it walks here aureoled with the city light
forever through the myriad featured mass
flaunting not far its fugitive embrace
heard sometimes in a song across the night
caught in a perfume from the crowds that pass
and when love yields to love seen face to face
to me a pilgrim on that journey bound
whose stations beauty's bright examples are
as of a silken city famed afar
over the sands for wealth and holy ground
came the report of one    a woman crowned
with all perfection blemishless and high
as the full moon amid the moonlit sky
with the world's praise and wonder clad around
and i who held this notion of success
to leave no form of nature's loveliness
unworshipped if glad eyes have access there
beyond all earthly bounds have made my goal
to find where that sweet shrine is and extol
the hand that triumphed in a work so fair
oft as by chance a little while apart
the pall of empty loveless hours withdrawn
sweet beauty opening on the impoverished heart
beams like the jewel on the breast of dawn
not though high heaven should rend would deeper awe
fill me than penetrates my spirit thus
nor all those signs the patmian prophet saw
seem a new heaven and earth so marvelous
but clad thenceforth in iridescent dyes
the fair world glistens and in after days
the memory of kind lips and laughing eyes
lives in my step and lightens all my face
so they who found the earthly paradise
still breathed returned of that sweet joyful place
amid the florid multitude her face
was like the full moon seen behind the lace
of orchard boughs where clouded blossoms part
when spring shines in the world and in the heart
as the full moon beams to the ferny floor
of summer woods through flower and foliage pour
so to my being's innermost recess
flooded the light of so much loveliness
she held as in a vase of priceless ware
the wine that over arid ways and bare
my youth was the pathetic thirsting for
and where she moved the veil of nature grew
diaphanous and that radiance mantled through
which when i see i tremble and adore
a splendor flamelike born to be pursued
with palms extent for amorous charity
and eyes incensed with love for all they see
a wonder more to be adored than wooed
on whom the grace of conscious womanhood
adorning every little thing she does
sits like enchantment making glorious
a careless pose a casual attitude
around her lovely shoulders mantle wise
hath come the realm of those old fabulous queens
whose storied loves are art's rich heritage
to keep alive in this our latter age
that force that moving through sweet beauty's means
lifts up man's soul to towering enterprise
when among creatures fair of countenance
love comes enformed in such proud character
so far as other beauty yields to her
so far the breast with fiercer longing pants
i bless the spot and hour and circumstance
that wed desire to a thing so high
and say glad soul rejoice for thou and i
of bliss unpaired are made participants
hence have come ardent thoughts and waking dreams
that feeding fancy from so sweet a cup
leave it no lust for gross imaginings
through her the woman's perfect beauty gleams
that while it gazes lifts the spirit up
to that high source from which all beauty springs
like as a dryad from her native bole
coming at dusk when the dim stars emerge
to a slow river at whose silent verge
tall poplars tremble and deep grasses roll
come thou no less and kneeling in a shoal
of the freaked flag and meadow buttercup
bend till thine image from the pool beam up
arched with blue heaven like an aureole
see how adorable in fancy then
lives the fair face it mirrors even so
o thou whose beauty moving among men
is like the wind's way on the woods below
filling all nature where its pathway lies
with arms that supplicate and trembling sighs
i fancied while you stood conversing there
superb in every attitude a queen
her ermine thus boadicea bare
so moved amid the multitude faustine
my life whose whole religion beauty is
be charged with sin if ever before yours
a lesser feeling crossed my mind than his
who owning grandeur marvels and adores
nay rather in my dream world's ivory tower
i made your image the high pearly sill
and mounting there in many a wistful hour
burdened with love i trembled and was still
seeing discovered from that azure height
remote untrod horizons of delight
it may be for the world of weeds and tares
and dearth in nature of sweet beauty's rose
that oft as fortune from ten thousand shows
one from the train of love's true courtiers
straightway on him who gazes unawares
deep wonder seizes and swift trembling grows
reft by that sight of purpose and repose
hardly its weight his fainting breast upbears
then on the soul from some ancestral place
floods back remembrance of its heavenly birth
when in the light of that serener sphere
it saw ideal beauty face to face
that through the forms of this our meaner earth
shines with a beam less steadfast and less clear
above the ruin of god's holy place
where man forsaken lay the bleeding rood
whose hands when men had craved substantial food
gave not nor folded when they cried embrace
i saw exalted in the latter days
her whom west winds with natal foam bedewed
wafted toward cyprus lily breasted nude
standing with arms out stretched and flower like face
and sick with all those centuries of tears
shed in the penance for factitious woe
once more i saw the nations at her feet
for love shone in their eyes and in their ears
come unto me love beckoned them for lo
the breast your lips abjured is still as sweet
who shall invoke her who shall be her priest
with single rites the common debt to pay
on some green headland fronting to the east
our fairest boy shall kneel at break of day
naked uplifting in a laden tray
new milk and honey and sweet tinctured wine
not without twigs of clustering apple spray
to wreath a garland for our lady's shrine
the morning planet poised above the sea
shall drop sweet influence through her drowsing lid
dew drenched his delicate virginity
shall scarce disturb the flowers he kneels amid
that waked so lightly shall lift up their eyes
cushion his knees and nod between his thighs
lay me where soft cyrene rambles down
in grove and garden to the sapphire sea
twine yellow roses for the drinker's crown
let music reach and fair heads circle me
watching blue ocean where the white sails steer
fruit laden forth or with the wares and news
of merchant cities seek our harbors here
careless how corinth fares how syracuse
but here with love and sleep in her caress
warm night shall sink and utterly persuade
the gentle doctrine aristippus bare
night winds and one whose white youth's loveliness
in a flowered balcony beside me laid
dreams with the starlight on her fragrant hair
stretched on a sunny bank he lay at rest
ferns at his elbow lilies round his knees
with sweet flesh patterned where the cool turf pressed
flowerlike crept o'er with emerald aphides
single he couched there to his circling flocks
piping at times some happy shepherd's tune
nude with the warm wind in his golden locks
and arched with the blue asian afternoon
past him gorse purpled to the distant coast
rolled the clear foothills  there his white walled town
there a blue band the placid euxine lay
beyond on fields of azure light embossed
he watched from noon till dewy eve came down
the summer clouds pile up and fade away
her eyes under their lashes were blue pools
fringed round with lilies her bright hair unfurled
clothed her as sunshine clothes the summer world
her robes were gauzes    gold and green and gules
all furry things flocked round her from her hand
nibbling their foods and fawning at her feet
two peacocks watched her where she made her seat
beside a fountain in broceliande
sometimes she sang     whoever heard forgot
errand and aim and knights at noontide here
riding from fabulous gestes beyond the seas
would follow tranced and seek    and find her not
but wake that night lost by some woodland mere
powdered with stars and rimmed with silent trees
i loved illustrious cities and the crowds
that eddy through their incandescent nights
i loved remote horizons with far clouds
girdled and fringed about with snowy heights
i loved fair women their sweet conscious ways
of wearing among hands that covet and plead
the rose ablossom at the rainbow's base
that bounds the world's desire and all its need
nature i worshipped whose fecundity
embraces every vision the most fair
of perfect benediction  from a boy
i gloated on existence  earth to me
seemed all sufficient and my sojourn there
one trembling opportunity for joy
i care not that one listen if he lives
for aught but life's romance nor puts above
all life's necessities the need to love
nor counts his greatest wealth what beauty gives
but sometime on an afternoon in spring
when dandelions dot the fields with gold
and under rustling shade a few weeks old
'tis sweet to stroll and hear the bluebirds sing
do you blond head whom beauty and the power
of being young and winsome have prepared
for life's last privilege that really pays
make the companion of an idle hour
these relics of the time when i too fared
across the sweet fifth lustrum of my days
as one of some fat tillage dispossessed
weighing the yield of these four faded years
if any ask what fruit seems loveliest
what lasting gold among the garnered ears
ah then i'll say what hours i had of thine
therein i reaped time's richest revenue
read in thy text the sense of david's line
through thee achieved the love that shakespeare knew
take then his book laden with mine own love
as flowers made sweeter by deep drunken rain
that when years sunder and between us move
wide waters and less kindly bonds constrain
thou may'st turn here dear boy and reading see
some part of what thy friend once felt for thee
be my companion under cool arcades
that frame some drowsy street and dazzling square
beyond whose flowers and palm tree promenades
white belfries burn in the blue tropic air
lie near me in dim forests where the croon
of wood doves sounds and moss banked water flows
or musing late till the midsummer moon
breaks through some ruined abbey's empty rose
sweetest of those to day whose pious hands
tend the sequestered altar of romance
where fewer offerings burn and fewer kneel
pour there your passionate beauty on my heart
and gladdening such solitudes impart
how sweet the fellowship of those who feel
the rooks aclamor when one enters here
startle the empty towers far overhead
through gaping walls the summer fields appear
green tan or poppy mingled tinged with red
the courts where revel rang deep grass and moss
cover and tangled vines have overgrown
the gate where banners blazoned with a cross
rolled forth to toss round tyre and ascalon
decay consumes it  the old causes fade
and fretting for the contest many a heart
waits their tyrtaeus to chant on the new
oh pass him by who in this haunted shade
musing enthralled has only this much art
to love the things the birds and flowers love too
though thou art now a ruin bare and cold
thou wert sometime the garden of a king
the birds have sought a lovelier place to sing
the flowers are few  it was not so of old
it was not thus when hand in hand there strolled
through arbors perfumed with undying spring
bare bodies beautiful brown glistening
decked with green plumes and rings of yellow gold
do you suppose the herdsman sometimes hears
vague echoes borne beneath the moon's pale ray
from those old old far off forgotten years
who knows  here where his ancient kings held sway
he stands  their names are strangers to his ears
even their memory has passed away
another prospect pleased the builder's eye
and fashion tenanted where fashion wanes
here in the sorrowful suburban lanes
when first these gables rose against the sky
relic of a romantic taste gone by
this stately monument alone remains
vacant with lichened walls and window panes
blank as the windows of a skull  but i
on evenings when autumnal winds have stirred
in the porch vines to this gray oracle
have laid a wondering ear and oft times heard
as from the hollow of a stranded shell
old voices echoing or my fancy erred
things indistinct but not insensible
a hilltop sought by every soothing breeze
that loves the melody of murmuring boughs
cool shades green acreage and antique house
fronting the ocean and the dawn than these
old monks built never for the spirit's ease
cloisters more calm    not cluny nor clairvaux
sweet are the noises from the bay below
and cuckoos calling in the tulip trees
here a yet empty suitor in thy train
beloved poesy great joy was mine
to while a listless spell of summer days
happier than hoarder in each evening's gain
when evenings found me richer by one line
one verse well turned or serviceable phrase
tonight a shimmer of gold lies mantled o'er
smooth lovely ocean  through the lustrous gloom
a savor steals from linden trees in bloom
and gardens ranged at many a palace door
proud walls rise here and where the moonbeams pour
their pale enchantment down the dim coast line
terrace and lawn trim hedge and flowering vine
crown with fair culture all the sounding shore
how sweet to such a place on such a night
from halls with beauty and festival a glare
to come distract and stretched on the cool turf
yield to some fond improbable delight
while the moon reddening sinks and all the air
sighs with the muffled tumult of the surf
a cloud has lowered that shall not soon pass o'er
the world takes sides  whether for impious aims
with tyranny whose bloody toll enflames
a generous people to heroic war
whether with freedom stretched in her own gore
whose pleading hands and suppliant distress
still offer hearts that thirst for righteousness
a glorious cause to strike or perish for
england which side is thine  thou hast had sons
would shrink not from the choice however grim
were justice trampled on and courage downed
which will they be    cravens or champions
oh if a doubt intrude remember him
whose death made missolonghi holy ground
i stood beside his sepulchre whose fame
hurled over europe once on bolt and blast
now glows far off as storm clouds overpast
glow in the sunset flushed with glorious flame
has nature marred his mould  can art acclaim
no hero now no man with whom men side
as with their hearts' high needs personified
there are will say one such our lips could name
columbia gave him birth  him genius most
gifted to rule  against the world's great man
lift their low calumny and sneering cries
the pharisaic multitude the host
of piddling slanderers whose little eyes
know not what greatness is and never can
sidney in whom the heyday of romance
came to its precious and most perfect flower
whether you tourneyed with victorious lance
or brought sweet roundelays to stella's bower
i give myself some credit for the way
i have kept clean of what enslaves and lowers
shunned the ideals of our present day
and studied those that were esteemed in yours
for turning from the mob that buys success
by sacrificing all life's better part
down the free roads of human happiness
i frolicked poor of purse but light of heart
and lived in strict devotion all along
to my three idols    love and arms and song
not that i always struck the proper mean
of what mankind must give for what they gain
but when i think of those whom dull routine
and the pursuit of cheerless toil enchain
who from their desk chairs seeing a summer cloud
race through blue heaven on its joyful course
sigh sometimes for a life less cramped and bowed
i think i might have done a great deal worse
for i have ever gone untied and free
the stars and my high thoughts for company
wet with the salt spray and the mountain showers
i have had the sense of space and amplitude
and love in many places silver shoed
has come and scattered all my path with flowers
why should you be astonished that my heart
plunged for so long in darkness and in dearth
should be revived by you and stir and start
as by warm april now reviving earth
i am the field of undulating grass
and you the gentle perfumed breath of spring
and all my lyric being when you pass
is bowed and filled with sudden murmuring
i asked you nothing and expected less
but with that deep impassioned tenderness
of one approaching what he most adores
i only wished to lose a little space
all thought of my own life and in its place
to live and dream and have my joy in yours
if i was drawn here from a distant place
'twas not to pray nor hear our friend's address
but gazing once more on your winsome face
to worship there ideal loveliness
on that pure shrine that has too long ignored
the gifts that once i brought so frequently
i lay this votive offering to record
how sweet your quiet beauty seemed to me
enchanting girl my faith is not a thing
by futile prayers and vapid psalm singing
to vent in crowded nave and public pew
my creed is simple  that the world is fair
and beauty the best thing to worship there
and i confess it by adoring you
seeing you have not come with me nor spent
this day's suggestive beauty as we ought
i have gone forth alone and been content
to make you mistress only of my thought
and i have blessed the fate that was so kind
in my life's agitations to include
this moment's refuge where my sense can find
refreshment and my soul beatitude
oh be my gentle love a little while
walk with me sometimes  let me see you smile
watching some night under a wintry sky
before the charge or on the bed of pain
these blessed memories shall revive again
and be a power to cheer and fortify
oh you are more desirable to me
than all i staked in an impulsive hour
making my youth the sport of chance to be
blighted or torn in its most perfect flower
for i think less of what that chance may bring
than how before returning into fire
to make my dearest memory of the thing
that is but now my ultimate desire
and in old times i should have prayed to her
whose haunt the groves of windy cyprus were
to prosper me and crown with good success
my will to make of you the rose twined bowl
from whose inebriating brim my soul
shall drink its last of earthly happiness
there have been times when i could storm and plead
but you shall never hear me supplicate
these long months that have magnified my need
have made my asking less importunate
for now small favors seem to me so great
that not the courteous lovers of old time
were more content to rule themselves and wait
easing desire with discourse and sweet rhyme
nay be capricious willful have no fear
to wound me with unkindness done or said
lest mutual devotion make too dear
my life that hangs by a so slender thread
and happy love unnerve me before may
for that stern part that i have yet to play
oh love of woman you are known to be
a passion sent to plague the hearts of men
for every one you bring felicity
bringing rebuffs and wretchedness to ten
i have been oft where human life sold cheap
and seen men's brains spilled out about their ears
and yet that never cost me any sleep
i lived untroubled and i shed no tears
fools prate how war is an atrocious thing
i always knew that nothing it implied
equalled the agony of suffering
of him who loves and loves unsatisfied
war is a refuge to a heart like this
love only tells it what true torture is
well seeing i have no hope then let us part
having long taught my flesh to master fear
i should have learned by now to rule my heart
although heaven knows 'tis not so easy near
oh you were made to make men miserable
and torture those who would have joy in you
but i who could have loved you dear so well
take pride in being a good loser too
and it has not been wholly unsuccess
for i have rescued from forgetfulness
some moments of this precious time that flies
adding to my past wealth of memory
the pretty way you once looked up at me
your low sweet voice your smile and your dear eyes
i have sought happiness but it has been
a lovely rainbow baffling all pursuit
and tasted pleasure but it was a fruit
more fair of outward hue than sweet within
renouncing both a flake in the ferment
of battling hosts that conquer or recoil
there only chastened by fatigue and toil
i knew what came the nearest to content
for there at least my troubled flesh was free
from the gadfly desire that plagued it so
discord and strife were what i used to know
heartaches deception murderous jealousy
by war transported far from all of these
amid the clash of arms i was at peace
apart sweet women for whom heaven be blessed
comrades you cannot think how thin and blue
look the leftovers of mankind that rest
now that the cream has been skimmed off in you
war has its horrors but has this of good
that its sure processes sort out and bind
brave hearts in one intrepid brotherhood
and leave the shams and imbeciles behind
now turn we joyful to the great attacks
not only that we face in a fair field
our valiant foe and all his deadly tools
but also that we turn disdainful backs
on that poor world we scorn yet die to shield
that world of cowards hypocrites and fools
clouds rosy tinted in the setting sun
depths of the azure eastern sky between
plains where the poplar bordered highways run
patched with a hundred tints of brown and green
beauty of earth when in thy harmonies
the cannon's note has ceased to be a part
i shall return once more and bring to these
the worship of an undivided heart
of those sweet potentialities that wait
for my heart's deep desire to fecundate
i shall resume the search if fortune grants
and the great cities of the world shall yet
be golden frames for me in which to set
new masterpieces of more rare romance
deep in the sloping forest that surrounds
the head of a green valley that i know
spread the fair gardens and ancestral grounds
of bellinglise the beautiful chateau
through shady groves and fields of unmown grass
it was my joy to come at dusk and see
filling a little pond's untroubled glass
its antique towers and mouldering masonry
oh should i fall to morrow lay me here
that o'er my tomb with each reviving year
wood flowers may blossom and the wood doves croon
and lovers by that unrecorded place
passing may pause and cling a little space
close bosomed at the rising of the moon
here where in happier times the huntsman's horn
echoing from far made sweet midsummer eves
now serried cannon thunder night and morn
tearing with iron the greenwood's tender leaves
yet has sweet spring no particle withdrawn
of her old bounty still the song birds hail
even through our fusillade delightful dawn
even in our wire bloom lilies of the vale
you who love flowers take these their fragile bells
have trembled with the shock of volleyed shells
and in black nights when stealthy foes advance
they have been lit by the pale rockets' glow
that o'er scarred fields and ancient towns laid low
trace in white fire the brave frontiers of france
i marked the young mimosa gaily dight
with feathery foliage trembling in the breeze
and tufts of golden flowers whence drowsy bees
sweet laden hummed their unrestrained delight
in after years the full grown tree i passed
its flowers and foliage gone and in their stead
a crop of huge white thorns inspiring dread
father i pray that when life's blooms are cast
and old age pours its snows upon my head
thy kindly hand whose pruning skill adorns
the trees of righteousness may lop my thorns
and may my roots with dewy moisture fed
nourish a stem to which a child may come
and fearless gather drops of crystal gum
behold that tree in autumn's dim decay
stripped by the frequent chill and eddying wind
where yet some yellow lonely leaves we find
lingering and trembling on the naked spray
twenty perchance for millions whirled away
emblem  alas too just  of human kind
vain man expects longevity designed
for few indeed and their protracted day
what is it worth that wisdom does not scorn
the blasts of sickness care and grief appal
that laid the friends in dust whose natal morn
rose near their own  and solemn is the call
yet like those weak deserted leaves forlorn
shivering they cling to life and fear to fall
praised be the poet who the sonnet's claim
severest of the orders that belong
distinct and separate to the delphic song
shall venerate nor its appropriate name
lawless assume peculiar is its frame
from him derived who shunned the city throng
and warbled sweet thy rocks and streams among
lonely valclusa
and that heir of fame
our greater milton hath by many a lay
formed on that arduous model fully shown
the english verse may happily display
those strict energic measures which alone
deserve the name of sonnet and convey
a grandeur grace and spirit all their own
my angel sister though thy lovely form
perished in youth's gay morning yet is mine
this precious ringlet  still the soft hairs shine
still glow the nut brown tints all bright and warm
with sunny gleam  alas each kindred charm
vanished long since deep in the silent shrine
withered to shapeless dust  and of their grace
memory alone retains the faithful trace
dear lock had thy sweet owner lived ere now
time on her brow had faded thee  my care
screened from the sun and dew thy golden glow
and thus her early beauty dost thou wear
thou all of that fair frame my love could save
from the resistless ravage of the grave
when i do count the clock that tells the time
and see the brave day sunk in hideous night
when i behold the violet past prime
and sable curls all silver'd o'er with white
when lofty trees i see barren of leaves
which erst from heat did canopy the herd
and summer's green all girded up in sheaves
borne on the bier with white and bristly beard
then of thy beauty do i question make
that thou among the wastes of time must go
since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake
and die as fast as they see others grow
and nothing 'gainst time's scythe can make defence
save breed to brave him when he takes thee hence
shall i compare thee to a summer's day
thou art more lovely and more temperate
rough winds do shake the darling buds of may
and summer's lease hath all too short a date
sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines
and often is his gold complexion dimm'd
and every fair from fair sometime declines
by chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd
but thy eternal summer shall not fade
nor lose possession of that fair thou owest
nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade
when in eternal lines to time thou growest
so long as men can breathe or eyes can see
so long lives this and this gives life to thee
when in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes
i all alone beweep my outcast state
and trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries
and look upon myself and curse my fate
wishing me like to one more rich in hope
featur'd like him like him with friends possess'd
desiring this man's art and that man's scope
with what i most enjoy contented least
yet in these thoughts myself almost despising
haply i think on thee  and then my state
like to the lark at break of day arising
from sullen earth sings hymns at heaven's gate
for thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings
that then i scorn to change my state with kings'
when to the sessions of sweet silent thought
i summon up remembrance of things past
i sigh the lack of many a thing i sought
and with old woes new wail my dear time's waste
then can i drown an eye unus'd to flow
for precious friends hid in death's dateless night
and weep afresh love's long since cancell'd woe
and moan the expense of many a vanish'd sight
then can i grieve at grievances foregone
and heavily from woe to woe tell o'er
the sad account of fore bemoaned moan
which i new pay as if not paid before
but if the while i think on thee dear friend
all losses are restor'd and sorrows end
not marble nor the gilded monuments
of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme
but you shall shine more bright in these contents
than unswept stone besmear'd with sluttish time
when wasteful war shall statues overturn
and broils root out the work of masonry
nor mars his sword nor war's quick fire shall burn
the living record of your memory
'gainst death and all oblivious enmity
shall you pace forth your praise shall still find room
even in the eyes of all posterity
that wear this world out to the ending doom
so till the judgment that yourself arise
you live in this and dwell in lovers' eyes
that time of year thou mayst in me behold
when yellow leaves or none or few do hang
upon those boughs which shake against the cold
bare ruined choirs where late the sweet birds sang
in me thou see'st the twilight of such day
as after sunset fadeth from the west
which by and by black night doth take away
death's second self that seals up all in rest
in me thou see'st the glowing of such fire
that on the ashes of his youth doth lie
as the deathbed whereon it must expire
consumed by that which it was nourished by
this thou perceiv'st which makes thy love more strong
to love that well which thou must leave ere long
farewell thou art too dear for my possessing
and like enough thou know'st thy estimate
the charter of thy worth gives thee releasing
my bonds in thee are all determinate
for how do i hold thee but by thy granting
and for that riches where is my deserving
the cause of this fair gift in me is wanting
and so my patent back again is swerving
thyself thou gavest thy own worth then not knowing
or me to whom thou gavest it else mistaking
so thy great gift upon misprision growing
comes home again on better judgment making
thus have i had thee as a dream doth flatter
in sleep a king but waking no such matter
they that have power to hurt and will do none
that do not do the thing they most do show
who moving others are themselves as stone
unmoved cold and to temptation slow
they rightly do inherit heaven's graces
and husband nature's riches from expense
they are the lords and owners of their faces
others but stewards of their excellence
the summer's flower is to the summer sweet
though to itself it only live and die
but if that flower with base infection meet
the basest weed outbraves his dignity
for sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds
lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds
the forward violet thus did i chide
sweet thief whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells
if not from my love's breath  the purple pride
which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells
in my love's veins thou hast too grossly dyed
the lily i condemnèd for thy hand
and buds of marjoram had stol'n thy hair
the roses fearfully on thorns did stand
one blushing shame another white despair
a third nor red nor white had stol'n of both
and to his robbery had annex'd thy breath
but for his theft in pride of all his growth
a vengeful canker eat him up to death
more flowers i noted yet i none could see
but sweet or colour it had stol'n from thee
let me not to the marriage of true minds
admit impediments love is not love
which alters when it alteration finds
or bends with the remover to remove
o no it is an ever fixed mark
that looks on tempests and is never shaken
it is the star to every wandering bark
whose worth's unknown although his height be taken
love's not time's fool though rosy lips and cheeks
within his bending sickle's compass come
love alters not with his brief hours and weeks
but bears it out even to the edge of doom
if this be error and upon me prov'd
i never writ nor no man ever lov'd
th' expense of spirit in a waste of shame
is lust in action and till action lust
is perjur'd murderous bloody full of blame
savage extreme rude cruel not to trust
enjoy'd no sooner but despised straight
past reason hunted and no sooner had
past reason hated as a swallow'd bait
on purpose laid to make the taker mad
mad in pursuit and in possession so
had having and in quest to have extreme
a bliss in proof  and prov'd a very woe
before a joy propos'd behind a dream
all this the world well knows yet none knows well
to shun the heaven that leads men to this hell
my mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun
coral is far more red than her lips' red
if snow be white why then her breasts are dun
if hairs be wires black wires grow on her head
i have seen roses damask'd red and white
but no such roses see i in her cheeks
and in some perfumes is there more delight
than in the breath that from my mistress reeks
i love to hear her speak  yet well i know
that music hath a far more pleasing sound
i grant i never saw a goddess go
my mistress when she walks treads on the ground
and yet by heaven i think my love as rare
as any she belied with false compare
two loves i have of comfort and despair
which like two spirits do suggest me still
the better angel is a man right fair
the worser spirit a woman colour'd ill
to win me soon to hell my female evil
tempteth my better angel from my side
and would corrupt my saint to be a devil
wooing his purity with her foul pride
and whether that my angel be turn'd fiend
suspect i may yet not directly tell
but being both from me both to each friend
i guess one angel in another's hell
yet this shall i ne'er know but live in doubt
till my bad angel fire my good one out
those lips that love's own hand did make
breathed forth the sound that said i hate
to me that languished for her sake
but when she saw my woeful state
straight in her heart did mercy come
chiding that tongue that ever sweet
was used in giving gentle doom
and taught it thus anew to greet
i hate she altered with an end
that followed it as gentle day
doth follow night who like a fiend
from heaven to hell is flown away
i hate from hate away she threw
and saved my life saying not you
i met a traveller from an antique land
who said two vast and trunkless legs of stone
stand in the desert    near them on the sand
half sunk a shattered visage lies whose frown
and wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command
tell that its sculptor well those passions read
which yet survive stamped on these lifeless things
the hand that mocked them and the heart that fed
and on the pedestal these words appear
my name is ozymandias king of kings
look on my works ye mighty and despair
nothing beside remains round the decay
of that colossal wreck boundless and bare
the lone and level sands stretch far away
an old mad blind despised and dying king
princes the dregs of their dull race who
through public scorn  mud from a muddy spring
rulers who neither see nor feel nor know
but leech like to their fainting country cling
till they drop blind in blood without a blow
a people starved and stabbed in the untilled field
an army which liberticide and prey
makes as a two edged sword to all who wield
golden and sanguine laws which tempt and slay
religion christless godless  a book sealed
a senate  time's worst statute unrepealed
are graves from which a glorious phantom may
burst to illumine our tempestuous day
lift not the painted veil which those who live
call life though unreal shapes be pictured there
and it but mimic all we would believe
with colours idly spread  behind lurk fear
and hope twin destinies who ever weave
their shadows o'er the chasm sightless and drear
i knew one who had lifted it  he sought
for his lost heart was tender things to love
but found them not alas nor was there aught
the world contains the which he could approve
through the unheeding many he did move
a splendour among shadows a bright blot
upon this gloomy scene a spirit that strove
for truth and like the preacher found it not
poet of nature thou hast wept to know
that things depart which never may return
childhood and youth friendship and love's first glow
have fled like sweet dreams leaving thee to mourn
these common woes i feel one loss is mine
which thou too feel'st yet i alone deplore
thou wert as a lone star whose light did shine
on some frail bark in winter's midnight roar
thou hast like to a rock built refuge stood
above the blind and battling multitude
in honored poverty thy voice did weave
songs consecrate to truth and liberty
deserting these thou leavest me to grieve
thus having been that thou shouldst cease to be
i hated thee fallen tyrant i did groan
to think that a most unambitious slave
like thou shouldst dance and revel on the grave
of liberty thou mightst have built thy throne
where it had stood even now thou didst prefer
a frail and bloody pomp which time has swept
in fragments towards oblivion massacre
for this i prayed would on thy sleep have crept
treason and slavery rapine fear and lust
and stifled thee their minister i know
too late since thou and france are in the dust
that virtue owns a more eternal foe
than force or fraud old custom legal crime
and bloody faith the foulest birth of time
what though i hear the aegean billows roar
and eye the deep where persia's navy rode
what have i left except my native shore
what have i changed beyond my mere abode
the fancied future aspirations high
which reason scarce could quell the upbraiding shame
of sloth mid busy crowds the weak desire
of that ideal feverish want a name
no longer tantalize the mental eye
when nought gives food to such tormenting fire
yet still the mournful memory of the past
clouding my spirit throws a deeper gloom
than even befits the scene a nation's tomb
and that i feel through every clime must last
hellas farewell  with anxious gaze i view
lovely in tears and injured as thou art
thy summits melting in the distant blue
fade from my eyes but linger in my heart
submissive silent victim dost thou feel
the chains which gall thee or has lengthened grief
numbed hate and shame alike with hope and zeal
and brought insensibility's relief
awake i adjured by every chief and sage
thou once couldst boast in many a meaner cause
and let the tame submission of an age
like nature's hushed and scarcely rustling pause
ere winds burst forth foretell the approaching storm
when thou shalt grasp the spear and raise thy prostrate form
winged wanderer from clover meadows sweet
where all day long beneath a smiling sky
you drained the wild flowers' cups of honey dry
and heard the drowsy winds their loves repeat
what idle zephyr whispering deceit
has won your heart and tempted you to fly
unto this noisy town and vainly pry
into the secrets of this busy street
to me your unexpected presence brings
a thought of fragrant pastures buds and flowers
and sleepy brooks and cattle in the fold
or watching as you soar on trembling wings
i think for those who toil through weary hours
you are a type of their uncertain gold
when pale selene in her crescent boat
sails down into the margin of the west
through shoals of stars that twinkle in unrest
in fancy's bark i follow her and float
o'er sapphire seas to dreamy realms remote
and at my side there goes a feathered guest
who sings to cheer me and the air is blest
with melody responsive to his note
on on i journey in the starry wake
and all about me is the purple dark
whence blow the winds by which my bark is borne
and suddenly the poppy fetters break
the moon is gone and in the field a lark
pays tribute to the faint pacific morn
october's peace hath fallen on everything
in the far west above the pine crowned hill
with red and purple yet the heavens thrill
the passing of the sun remembering
a crow sails by on heavy flapping wing
in some land surely the young spring hath her will
below the little city lieth still
and on the river's breast the mist wreaths cling
here on this slope that yet hath known no plough
the cattle wander homeward slowly now
in shapeless clumps the ferns are brown and dead
among the fir trees dusk is swiftly born
the maples will be desolate by morn
the last word of the summer hath been said
though all the light were lifted from the land
and a great darkness lay upon the sea
though groping each for some not careless hand
i felt sad men pass over wearily
though it were certain dawn would not come in
with the next hour that after many days
would no moon rise where the grey clouds grew thin
nor any stars resume their ancient ways
though all my world was thus and i more blind
than the dead blundering planets raining past
i know i should not fancy time unkind
for you as once of old you came at last
would surely come and with unfaltering faith
lead me beyond the dominance of death
let us rise up and live behold each thing
is ready for the moulding of our hand
long have they all awaited our command
none other will they ever own for king
until we come no bird dare try to sing
nor any sea its power may understand
no buds are on the trees in every land
year asketh year some tidings of some spring
yea it is time  high time we were awake
simple indeed shall life be unto us
what part is ours  to take what all things give
to feel the whole world growing for our sake
to have sure knowledge of the marvellous
to laugh and love  let us rise up and live
i marked the slow withdrawal of the year
out on the hills the scarlet maples shone
the glad first herald of triumphant dawn
a robin's song fell through the silence  clear
as long ago it rang when june was here
then suddenly a few grey clouds were drawn
across the sky and all the song was gone
and all the gold was quick to disappear
that day the sun seemed loth to come again
and all day long the low wind spoke of rain
far off beyond the hills and moaned like one
wounded among the pines as though the earth
knowing some giant grief had come to birth
had wearied of the summer and the sun
pale primrose lingering for the evening star
to bless thee with its beam  like some fair child
who ere he rests on morpheus' downy car
doth wait his mother's blessing pure and mild
to hallow his gay dream his red lips breathe
the prompted prayer fast by that parent's knee
even as thou rear'st thy sweetly fragrant wreath
to matron evening while she smiles on thee
go to thy rest pale flower the star hath shed
his benison upon thy bosom fair
the dews of summer bathe thy pensive head
and weary man forgets his daily care
sleep on my rose till morning gilds the sky
and bright aurora's kiss unseal thy trembling eye
what need have i to fear  so soon to die
let me work on not watch and wait in dread
what will it matter when that i am dead
that they bore hate or love that near me lie
'tis but a lifetime and the end is nigh
at best or worst let me lift up my head
and firmly as with inner courage tread
mine own appointed way on mandates high
pain could but bring from all its evil  store
the close of pain hate's venom could but kill
repulse defeat desertion could no more
let me have lived my life not cowered until
the unhindered and unchastened hour was here
so soon  what is there now for me to fear
huge vapours brood above the clifted shore
night on the ocean settles dark and mute
save where is heard the repercussive roar
of drowsy billows on the rugged foot
of rocks remote or still more distant tone
of seamen in the anchored bark that tell
the watch relieved or one deep voice alone
singing the hour and bidding strike the bell
all is black shadow but the lucid line
marked by the light surf on the level sand
or where afar the ship lights faintly shine
like wandering fairy fires that oft on land
misled the pilgrim  such the dubious ray
that wavering reason lends in life's long darkling way
he may be envied who with tranquil breast
can wander in the wild and woodland scene
when summer's glowing hands have newly dressed
the shadowy forests and the copses green
who unpursued by care can pass his hours
where briony and woodbine fringe the trees
on thymy banks reposing while the bees
murmur their fairy tunes in praise of flowers
or on the rock with ivy clad and fern
that overhangs the osier whispering bed
of some clear current bids his wishes turn
from this bad world and by calm reason led
knows in refined retirement to possess
my friendship hallowed rural happiness
of folly weary shrinking from the view
of violence and fraud allowed to take
all peace from humble life i would forsake
their haunts for ever and sweet nymph with you
find shelter where my tired and tear swoln eyes
among your silent shades of soothing hue
your bells and florets of unnumbered dyes
might rest  and learn the bright varieties
that from your lovely hands are fed with dew
and every veineacuted leaf that trembling sighs
in mead or woodland or in wilds remote
or lurk with mosses in the humid caves
mantle the cliffs on dimpling rivers float
or stream from coral rocks beneath the ocean waves
the upland shepherd as reclined he lies
on the soft turf that clothes the mountain brow
marks the bright sea line mingling with the skies
or from his course celestial sinking low
the summer sun in purple radiance glow
blaze on the western waters the wide scene
magnificent and tranquil seems to spread
even over the rustic's breast a joy serene
when like dark plague spots by the demons shed
charged deep with death upon the waves far seen
move the war freighted ships and fierce and red
flash their destructive fires  the mangled dead
and dying victims then pollute the flood
ah thus man spoils glorious works with blood
over faded heath flowers spun or thorny furze
the filmy gossamer is lightly spread
waving in every sighing air that stirs
as fairy fingers had entwined the thread
a thousand trembling orbs of lucid dew
spangle the texture of the fairy loom
as if soft sylphs lamenting as they flew
had wept departed summer's transient bloom
but the wind rises and the turf receives
the glittering web  so evanescent fade
bright views that youth with sanguine heart believes
so vanish schemes of bliss by fancy made
which fragile as the fleeting dews of morn
leave but the withered heath and barren thorn
should the lone wanderer fainting on his way
rest for a moment of the sultry hours
and though his path through thorns and roughness lay
pluck the wild rose or woodbine's gadding flowers
weaving gay wreaths beneath some sheltering tree
the sense of sorrow he awhile may lose
so have l sought thy flowers fair poesy
so charmed my way with friendship and the muse
but darker now grows life's unhappy day
dark with new clouds of evil yet to come
her pencil sickening fancy throws away
and weary hope reclines upon the tomb
and points my wishes to that tranquil shore
where the pale spectre care pursues no more
queen of the silver bow  by thy pale beam
alone and pensive i delight to stray
and watch thy shadow trembling in the stream
or mark the floating clouds that cross thy way
and while i gaze thy mild and placid light
sheds a soft calm upon my troubled breast
and oft i think  fair planet of the night
that in thy orb the wretched may have rest
the sufferers of the earth perhaps may go
released by death  to thy benignant sphere
and the sad children of despair and woe
forget in thee their cup of sorrow here
oh that i soon may reach thy world serene
poor wearied pilgrim  in this toiling scene
come balmy sleep tired nature's soft resort
on these sad temples all thy poppies shed
and bid gay dreams from morpheus' airy court
float in light vision round my aching head
secure of all thy blessings partial power
on his hard bed the peasant throws him down
and the poor sea boy in the rudest hour
enjoys thee more than he who wears a crown
clasped in her faithful shepherd's guardian arms
well may the village girl sweet slumbers prove
and they o gentle sleep still taste thy charms
who wake to labor liberty and love
but still thy opiate aid dost thou deny
to calm the anxious breast to close the streaming eye
o thou who sleep'st where hazel bands entwine
the vernal grass with paler violets drest
i would sweet maid thy humble bed were mine
and mine thy calm and enviable rest
for never more by human ills opprest
shall thy soft spirit fruitlessly repine
thou canst not now thy fondest hopes resign
even in the hour that should have made thee blest
light lies the turf upon thy virgin breast
and lingering here to love and sorrow true
the youth who once thy simple heart possest
shall mingle tears with april's early dew
while still for him shall faithful memory save
thy form and virtues from the silent grave
when thou didst leave me hope why didst thou not
in place of thy sweet presence leave despair
with her grim visage and distorted hair
the past the future then had been forgot
the soul concentred on its blasted lot
had rested mute and desolate of care
had ceased to question where its treasures were
and roamed no more the melancholy spot
but now too much remembering of the past
so huge the weight of gloom around me spread
that i like one within a charnel cast
hear but the dirges ringing for the dead
feel all the pangs of life and thought and breath
yet walk i all the time with hand in hand of death
the sabbath morning from the night awoke
all sunshine crowned rough men disdaining toil
had cleared their brows from work day's hardening moil
and by the fountain left the cove'd yoke
through morning glory and the hollyhock
and rich nasturtium shading with their coil
the cottage window and the heated soil
aslant the white board floor the sunshine broke
and left a flowery tracery in the sheen
this inward gleam the children newly kempt
and genial matron calm from work day ways
who sits with stately grace her flock between
and sings a sabbath hymm meseems exempt
like these from strife seraphim legions join the praise
a simple thing yet chancing as it did
when life was bright with its illusive dreams
a pledge and promise seemed beneath it hid
the ocean lay before me tinged with beams
that lingering draped the west a wavering stir
and at my feet down fell a worn gray quill
and eagle high above the darkling fir
with steady flight seemed there to take his fill
of that pure ether breathed by him alone
o noble bird why didst thou loose for me
thy eagle plume still unessayed unknown
must be that pathway fearless winged by thee
i ask it not no lofty flight be mine
i would not soar like thee in loneliness to pine
here from earth's daeligdal heights and dingles lowly
the representatives of nature meet
not like a congress or alliance holy
of kings to rivet chains but with their sweet
blossomy mouths to preach the love complete
that with pearled mistletoe and beaded holly
clothed them in green unchangeable to greet
winter with smiles and banish melancholy
l envy not the emathian madman's fame
who won the world and built immortal shame
on tears and blood but if some flower new found
in its embalming cup might shroud my name
mine were a tomb more worthily renowned
than cheops' pile or artemisia's mound
the soaring lark from swelling breast may sound
exultant strains that thrill the world below
the thrush on flute melodious may blow
the sweet sad tones that stir the soul profound
but haply too on lonely shady mound
the wood bird pipes a heart song soft and low
that through her own breast sends a cheery glow
yet brightness too the little world around
and may not one who feels his bosom swell
and thrill at every note sublime and strong
who loves the sweet sad melodies that dwell
and linger in the heart's recesses long
the while himself he cheers attempt as well
to lighten others with his artless song
colin my dear and most entire beloved
my muse audacious stoops her pitch to thee
desireing that thy patience be not moved
by these rude lines written here you see
fain would my muse whom cruel love hath wronged
shroud her love labors under thy protection
and i myself with ardent zeal have longed
that thou mightst know to thee my true affection
therefore good colin graciously accept
a few sad sonnets which my muse hath framed
though they but newly from the shell are crept
suffer them not by envy to be blamed
but underneath the shadow of thy wings
give warmth to these young hatcheacuted orphan things
feed silly sheep although your keeper pineth
yet like to tantalus doth see his food
skip you and leap no bright apollo shineth
whilst i bewail my sorrows in yon wood
where woeful philomela doth record
and sings with notes of sad and dire lament
the tragedy wrought by her sister's lord
i'll bear a part in her black discontent
that pipe which erst was wont to make you glee
upon these downs whereon you careless graze
shall to her mournful music tuned be
let not my plaints poor lambkins you amaze
there underneath that dark and dusky bower
whole showers of tears to chloris i will pour
whole showers of tears to chloris i will pour
as true oblations of my sincere love
if that will not suffice most fairest flower
then shall my sighs thee unto pity move
if neither tears nor sighs can aught prevail
my streaming blood thine anger shall appease
this hand of mine by vigor shall assail
to tear my heart asunder thee to please
celestial powers on you i invocate
you now the chaste affections of my mind
i never did my faith yet violate
why should my chloris then be so unkind
that neither tears nor sighs nor streaming blood
can unto mercy move her cruel mood
when i more large thy praises forth shall show
that all the world thy beauty shall admire
desiring that most sacred nymph to know
which hath the shepherd's fancy set on fire
till then my dear let these thine eyes content
till then fair love think if i merit favor
till then oh let thy merciful assent
relish my hopes with some comforting savor
so shall you add such courage to my muse
that she shall climb the steep parnassus hill
that learned poets shall my deeds peruse
when i from thence obtainegraved have more skill
and what i sing shall always be of thee
as long as life or breath remains in me
a wrinkled crabbed man they picture thee
old winter with a rugged beard as grey
as the long moss upon the apple tree
blue lipt an icedrop at thy sharp blue nose
close muffled up and on thy dreary way
plodding alone through sleet and drifting snows
they should have drawn thee by the high heapt hearth
old winter seated in thy great armed chair
watching the children at their christmas mirth
or circled by them as thy lips declare
some merry jest or tale of murder dire
or troubled spirit that disturbs the night
pausing at times to rouse the mouldering fire
or taste the old october brown and bright
go valentine and tell that lovely maid
whom fancy still will portray to my sight
how here i linger in this sullen shade
this dreary gloom of dull monastic night
say that every joy of life remote
at evening's closing hour i quit the throng
listening in solitude the ring dome's note
who pours like me her solitary song
say that of her absence calls the sorrowing sigh
say that of all her charms i love to speak
in fancy feel the magic of her eye
in fancy view the smile illume her cheek
court the lone hour when silence stills the grove
and heave the sigh of memory and of love
if thou didst feed on western plains of yore
or waddle wide with flat and flabby feet
over some cambrian mountain's plashy moor
or find in farmer's yard a safe retreat
from gipsy thieves and foxes sly and fleet
if thy grey quills by lawyer guided trace
deeds big with ruin to some wretched race
or love sick poet's sonnet sad and sweet
wailing the rigour of some lady fair
or if the drudge of housemaid's daily toil
cobwebs and dust thy pinion white besoil
departed goose i neither know nor care
but this i know that thou wert very fine
seasoned with sage and onions and port wine
let ancient stories round the painter's art
who stole from many a maid his venus' charms
till warm devotion fired each gazer's heart
and every bosom bounded with alarms
he culled the beauties of his native isle
from some the blush of beauty's vermeil dyes
from some the lovely look the winning smile
from some the languid lustre of the eyes
low to the finished form the nations round
in adoration bent the pious knee
with myrtle wreaths the artist's brow they crowned
whose skill ariste only imaged thee
ill fated artist doomed so wide to seek
the charms that blossom on ariste's cheek
hold your mad hands for ever on your plain
must the gorged vulture clog his beak with blood
for ever must your niger's tainted flood
roll to the ravenous shark his banquet slain
hold your mad hands and learn at length to know
and turn your vengeance on the common foe
yon treacherous vessel and her godless crew
let never traders with false pretext fair
set on your shores again their wicked feet
with interdict and indignation meet
repel them and with fire and sword pursue
avarice the white cadaverous fiend is there
who spreads his toils accursed wide and far
and for his purveyor calls the demon war
high in the air exposed the slave is hung
to all the birds of heaven their living food
he groans not though awaked by that fierce sun
new torturers live to drink their parent blood
he groans not though the gorging vulture tear
the quivering fiber hither look o ye
who tore this man from peace and liberty
look hither ye who weigh with politic care
the gain against the guilt beyond the grave
there is another world bear ye in mind
ere your decree proclaims to all mankind
the gain is worth the guilt that there the slave
before the eternal thunder tongued shall plead
against the deep damnation of your deed
let me not lay the lightest feather's weight
of duty upon love let not my own
the breath of one reluctant kiss be blown
between our hearts i would not be the gate
that bars like some inexorable fate
the portals of thy life that says alone
through me shall any joy to thee be known
rather the window fragrant early and late
with thy sweet clinging thoughts that grow and twine
around me like some bright and blooming vine
through which the sun shall shed his wealth on thee
in golden showers through which thou may'st look out
exulting in all beauty without doubt
or fear or shadow of regret from me
great cities that defied time's power are dust
and mighty temples ruins yet this gem
seeming a fragile thing outliveth them
its beauty bears no trace of time's keen thrust
undimmed the marvellous lustre that doth trust
to none its secret every delicate line
glows with immortal freshness and divine
that fears no ravage of decay or rust
how infinite is art a magic glass
this tiny chiselled disk becomes to me
greece and her glories rise and shine and pass
before my dazzled eyes then fade to wan
and spectral shores where the aegean sea
guards the lone ruins of the parthenon
upon the beach i walked at eve alone
and listened to the moaning of the sea
and watched the sails that in the moonlight shone
as the horizon straightway unto me
there came a voice as from below the waves
the less'ning sail will soon be seen no more
and as i sweep thy footprints from the shore
time mosses o'er a world of unknown graves
and it is well if men could not forget
with phantoms all the world would peopled be
the ghosts of buried joys their hearts would fret
a flood of tears like blood would drown the sea
rail not at time  the healer of thy woes
as of those thou hast forgotten shall be thy last repose
with eyes suffused and heart dissolved with sorrow
how often have i fled the realms of sleep
and sought not vainly from thy page to borrow
that which forbids or eye or heart to weep
thy thanatopsis fraught with tenderest feeling
is like a june breeze to the ice bound heart
to us thy humble followers revealing
the sage the seer the poet that thou art
still roll the ages still green river flows
and odorous blossoms load the apple tree
into the lake still fall the fleecy snows
and nature everywhere doth speak of thee
oh for a poet's tongue to name thy name
but does it matter thine is deathless fame
o sea that to these grey and solemn shores
dost pour thy plaint through all the circling years
i would that to my ever listening ears
some spirit might translate thy language roars
the wave that spends its force against the rocks
that its assaults deride a giant's pain
it voices soft dost thou complain
by pebbly beach to summer's fields and flocks
tell'st thou of cities hid beneath thy breast
of famed atlantis known in story only
of sepulchres innumerable where rest
the wrecks of ages peacefully and lonely
tell why thou plaintest melancholy sea
and the sea answers hush it may not be
the twilight shadows creep along the wall
without the sobbing of the wind i hear
and from the vine clad elm that marks the mere
the ivy leaves in crimson eddies fall
deeper and deeper grow the shades of night
and gazing in the fire to me appears
the form of one departed with the years
the buried years of hope and faith and light
oh that those lips had language  would they tell
the old old story of the bygone days
ere on our heart the blighting shadow fell
and we henceforward followed parted ways
i ask but as i ask the embers die
the vision fades  and answer none have i
happy ye leaves whenas those lily hands
which hold my life in their dead doing might
shall handle you and hold in love's soft bands
like captives trembling at the victor's sight
and happy lines on which with starry light
those lamping eyes will deign sometimes to look
and read the sorrows of my dying sprite
written with tears in heart's close bleeding book
and happy rhymes bathed in the sacred brook
of helicon whence she derived is
when ye behold that angel's blessed look
my soul's long lacked food my heaven's bliss
leaves lines and rhymes seek her to please alone
whom if ye please i care for other none
most glorious lord of life that on this day
didst make thy triumph over death and sin
and having harrowed hell didst bring away
captivity thence captive us to win
this joyous day dear lord with joy begin
and grant that we for whom thou diddest die
being with thy dear blood clean washed from sin
may live forever in felicity
and that thy love we weighing worthily
may likewise love thee for the same again
and for thy sake that all like dear didst buy
may love with one another entertain
so let us love dear love like as we ought
love is the lesson which the lord us taught
one day i wrote her name upon the strand
but came the waves and washed it away
again i wrote it with a second hand
but came the tide and made my pains his prey
vain man said she that dost in vain assay
a mortal thing so to immortalize
for i myself shall like to this decay
and eek my name be wiped out likewise
not so quoth i let baser things devise
to die in dust but you shall live by fame
my verse your virtues rare shall eternize
and in the heavens write your glorious name
where whenas death shall all the world subdue
our love shall live and later life renew
fair is my love when her fair golden hairs
with the loose wind ye waving chance to mark
fair when the rose in her red cheeks appears
or in her eyes the fire of love does spark
fair when her breast like a rich laden bark
with precious merchandise she forth doth lay
fair when that cloud of pride which oft doth dark
her goodly light with smiles she drives away
but fairest she when so she doth display
the gate with pearls and rubies richly dight
through which her words so wise do make their way
to bear the message of her gentle sprite
the rest be works of nature's wonderment
but this the work of heart's astonishment
bayard awaken not this music strong
while round thy home the indolent sweet breeze
floats lightly as the summer breath of seas
o'er which ulysses heard the siren's song
dreams of low lying isles to june belong
and circe holds us in her haunts of ease
but later when these high ancestral trees
are sere and such melodious languors wrong
the reddening strength of the autumnal year
yield to heroic words thy ear and eye
intent on these broad pages thou shalt hear
the trumpets' blare the argive battle cry
and see achilles hurl his hurtling spear
and mark the trojan arrows make reply
she seemed an angel to our infant eyes
once when the glorifying moon revealed
her who at evening by our pillow kneeled
soft voiced and golden haired from holy skies
flown to her loves on wings of paradise
we looked to see the pinions half concealed
the tuscan vines and olives will not yield
her back to me who loved her in this wise
and since have little known her but have grown
to see another mother tenderly
watch over sleeping children of my own
perchance the years have changed her yet alone
this picture lingers still she seems to me
the fair young angel of my infancy
bring no more flowers and books and precious things
o speak no more of our beloved art
of summer haunts  melodious wanderings
in leafy refuge from this weary mart
surely such thoughts were dear unto my heart
now every word a newer sadness brings
thus oft some forest bird caged far apart
from verdurous freedom droops his careless wings
nor craves for more than food from day to day
so long bereft of wild wood joy and song
hopeless of all he dared to hope so long
the music born within him dies away
even the song he loved becomes a pain
full freighted with a yearning all in vain
two voices are there one is of the deep
it learns the storm cloud's thunderous melody
now roars now murmurs with the changing sea
now bird like pipes now closes soft in sleep
and one is of an old half witted sheep
which bleats articulate monotony
and indicates that two and one are three
that grass is green lakes damp and mountains steep
and wordsworth both are thine at certain times
forth from the heart of thy melodious rhymes
the form and pressure of high thoughts will burst
at other times good lord i'd rather be
quite unacquainted with the abc
than write such hopeless rubbish as thy worst
the morning is ten thousand miles away
the winter night surrounds me vast and cold
without a star the voiceless fog is rolled
from ocean levels desolate and grey
but over all the floods of moonlight lay
a glory on those billows that enfold
the muffled sea and forest gaunt and old
the dripping redwoods wait the distant day
unknown above what silver dripping waves
break slowly on the purple reefs of night
what radiant foam ascends from shadowy bars
or sinks unechoing to soundless caves
no whisper is upon those tides of light
setting in silence toward the risen stars
o phantom sea pale spirit of unrest
there is no thunder where your billows break
morning shall be your strand your waters make
an island of the mountain top whose crest
is lonely on the ocean of your breast
no sail is there save what our visions take
of mist and moonlight on whose ghostly wake
our dreams go forth unuttered to the west
the splendour on your tides is high and far
seen by the mind alone whose wings can sweep
on wilder glories and a vaster deep
chill are your gulfs o sea without a song
hiding the heavens from man man from the star
to which your parent sea endures as long
from out eternal silence do we come
into eternal silence do we go
for was there not a time and swift or slow
must come again when all this world's loud hum
was naught to us and shall again grow dumb
through all eternity  between two low
dark stony portals with much empty show
of tinkling brass and sounding fife and drum
the endless caravan of life moves on
or whence or whither to what destiny
but he who dwells beyond the farthest dawn
knows yet reveals not evermore even he
in silence wrapt for all the thunders roll
save for his deathless message to our soul
sweet natured lord at whose birth all the spheres
tuned their best harmony and on whose head
kind heaven its choicest dews in plenty shed
teach me what secrets in this vale of tears
support thy easy mind vain hopes and fears
that over the rest a chequered shadow spread
leave thee unclouded thou dost gaily tread
as in a path that sunshine never cheers
whence is this learnt ah no the solemn brow
the grave deportment that with careful scan
measures each step on level ground and even
but trips on rough  these may be learnt we know
these have by that vile beast resembling man
but thy philosophy is all from heaven
after long days of dull perpetual rain
and from gray skies the sun at last shines bright
and all the sparkling trees are glad with light
and all the happy world laughs out again
the sorrow is forgotten past the pain
for nature has no memory feels the blight
of no regret nor mars the day's delight
with idle fears and hopes and longings vain
ah me it is not so with us the ghost
of vanished joys pursues us everywhere
we live as much in all that we have lost
as what we own no present is so fair
that the best moment's sunlight is not crossed
by shadowy shapes of hope and fear and care
we are pursued by fate nothing on earth
flowers into satisfaction on the skirt
of all temptation hidden yet alert
hangs disappointment ready to spring forth
and jar with discord the clear song of mirth
even our best pleasure has the sting of hurt
and prayers and tears are futile to avert
the nemesis that haunts us from our birth
oh what avail our struggles who are caught
in fate's inextricable web in vain
through the dark future our exhausted thought
seeks for a resting place secure from pain
our present crumbles 'neath us while we laugh
our past has but a sigh for epitaph
little we know what secret influence
a word a glance a casual tone may bring
that like the wind's breath on a chorded string
may thrill the memory touch the inner sense
and waken dreams that come we know not whence
or like the light touch of a bird's swift wing
the lake's still face a moment visiting
leave pulsing rings when he has vanished thence
you looked into my eyes an instant's space
and all the boundaries of time and place
broke down and far into a world beyond
of buried hopes and dreams my soul had sight
where dim desires long lost and memories fond
rose in a soft mirage of tender light
columbus came to thee and called the new
new world to him but thy rich blood bright gold
lay cold where once the fires manifold
raged fiercely new primeval forests grew
had fallen and were coal thine eagles flew
undaunted then as now and where the bold
south rocky mountains rise in fold on fold
the aztec to his god the victim slew
the tropic verdure of thy far north world
had passed for ever moon like fading out
sky piercing mounts have reared them from the seas
the lost atlantis has been depth ward hurled
since thou wert new  old all thy landmarks shout
and bid us read thy waiting mysteries
from its frail stem tear not the rose you said
nor brush from wings so fragile all their gold
lest in your unrewarded hand you hold
only alas torn plumes and petals dead
ah plead no more  you bowed your troubled head
lest we who loved and listened dear of old
in life's cage kiss this singing glory cold
and find bruised petals where the rose hung red
i take the solace and endure the smart
bend close o wondering brow and turn to me
thos wistful lips those eyes of mournful blue
where still the old smile steals for light of heart
the fleeting rose the unassuaging voices see
i leave and lose but you  oh never you
not because beauty is as thin and bright
in you as the white outline of a tree
in winter but because i find delight
in the curved sadness of your lips i see
pleasanter things each day each day recall
happy faces laughter that knew a way
to spin senses to oblivion    all
your words are swift upon your lips and grey
as swallows yet i stay to listen yet
i cannot tear myself away from you
for in a little while you may forget
your sadness o no matter what i do
you may forget your sadness    o my dear
and even smile and make the mystery clear
time i rejoice amid the ruin wide
that peoples thy dark empire to behold
shores against which thy waves in vain have rolled
where man's proud works still frown above thy tide
the deep based pyramids still turn aside
thy wasteful currents vigorously old
lucania's temples their array unfold
pillar and portico in simple pride
nor less my joy when sheltered from thy storms
in earth's fond breast hid treasure bursts the sod
elaborate stone in sculpture's matchless forms
oft did i mock thee spoiler as i trod
the glowing courts where still the goddess warms
and stern in beauty stands the quivered god
i stood at gaze where the free hills arise
whence rocks mid deepest solitudes are seen
and glimmering through dark foliage the blue sheen
of ocean stained with heaven's own sapphire dyes
then into the deep air i raised my eyes
the steadfast dome was cloudless and serene
fit roof to over arch so fair a scene
for earth in loveliness vied with the skies
enrolled methought among a happier race
i felt immortal moments as i said
death finds no entrance here and sin no place
then quick to mark where recent footsteps led
i saw one bending over the furrow's trace
and on his brow the primal sentence read
my window's open to the evening sky
the solemn trees are fringed with golden light
the lawn here shadowed lies there kindles bright
and cherished roses lift their incense high
the punctual thrush on plane tree warbling nigh
with loud and luscious voice calls down the night
dim waters flowing on with gentle might
between each pause are heard to murmur by
the book that told of wars in holy land
nor less than tasso sounded in mine ears
escapes unheeded from my listless hand
poets whom nature for her service rears
like priests in her great temple ministering stand
but in her glory fade when she appears
is this the spot where rome's eternal foe
into his snares the mighty legions drew
whence from the carnage spiritless and few
a remnant scarcely reached her gates of woe
is this the stream thus gliding soft and slow
that from the gushing wounds of thousands grew
so fierce a flood that waves of crimson hue
rushed on the bosom of the lake below
the mountains that gave back the battle cry
are silent now perchance yon hillocks green
mark where the bones of those old warriors lie
heaven never gladdened a more peaceful scene
never left softer breeze a fairer sky
to sport upon thy waters thrasymene
deliver me from mine own dreams but save
from mine own thoughts for these too busy still
fill up the mightiest measure of mine ill
and form the darkest doom that i must brave
deliverance then from these i deeply crave
but patience this must need and power and skill
for the great heart is cunning and its will
right tyrannous say who stoops not as its slave
the heart is as a giant in its might
and doth in mastery of its greatness tower
and riseth in its strength to blast and blight
heart thou art a host of giants in thine hour
the passions are thy warriors and these fight
as though their arms were storms the thunder's conquering dower
listen awhile but lend me thy loved ear
and i will teach my soul of souls to thine
the coils of thought will curiously untwine
and strive to show how deeply thou art dear
but first must i full many a mist of fear
and cloud of grief that dull this doom of mine
essay to chase away ere yet can shine
the star of perfect love full strong and clear
then then behold it all one blaze of light
itself a glowing firmament of fire
all unextinguishably clear and bright
though oft thus girt by clouds deep dark and dire
that do disturb its splendour check its might
listen and smile and bid these heavy glooms retire
i cannot rule my thoughts that round one theme
hang like to swarming bees till all grow one
and yet that theme i fain would learn to shun
it is my life's too fair but fatal dream
too dangerous do its deep enchantments seem
but dearer than my soul  undone undone
i cannot rule my thoughts each rising sun
sees me still drifting farther down the stream
o fearful stream of passion wave by wave
dost thou engulf my being must it be
is there no power to strengthen or to save
no tokens of a change these eyes can see
days past and days to come one likeness have
i know my future so it seems a memory
there is a music in my mind tonight
a visitation of sweet thoughts and rare
i know not whence but feel them springing there
aeumlry and delicate as wind or light
that music in my mind of magic might
this light cast down on every thought so fair
this stirring sweetness like to moving air
can this be love  the immortal and the bright
it is surely love for nought beside can be
so strange and yet so sweet so soft yet strong
it is love the crown of all crowned mystery
my thoughts are gathering to a starry throng
and scattering forth their brightness far and free
yet love that sun shines dazzling these among
the soote season that bud and bloom forth brings
with green hath clad the hill and eke the vale
the nightingale with feathers new she sings
the turtle to her make hath told her tale
summer is come for every spray now springs
the hart hath hung his old head on the pale
the buck in brake his winter coat he flings
the fishes flete with new repaired scale
the adder all her slough away she slings
the swift swallow pursueth the flyes smale
the busy bee her honey now she mings
winter is worn that was the flowers' bale
and thus i see among these pleasant things
each care decays and yet my sorrow springs
love that doth reign and live within my thought
and built his seat within my captive breast
clad in arms wherein with me he fought
oft in my face he doth his banner rest
but she that taught me love and suffer pain
my doubtful hope and eke my hot desire
with shamefaced look to shadow and refrain
her smiling grace converteth straight to ire
and coward love then to the heart apace
taketh his flight where he doth lurk and 'plain
his purpose lost and dare not show his face
for my lord's guilt thus faultless bide i pain
yet from my lord shall not my foot remove
sweet is the death that taketh end by love
set me whereas the sun doth parch the green
or where his beams do not dissolve the ice
in temperate heat where he is felt and seen
in presence prest of people mad or wise
set me in high or yet in low degree
in longest night or in the shortest day
in clearest sky or where clouds thickest be
in lusty youth or when my hairs are gray
set me in heaven in earth or else in hell
in hill or dale or in the foaming flood
thrall or at large alive whereso i dwell
sick or in health in evil fame or good
hers will i be and only with this thought
content myself although my chance be nought
that nose is out of drawing with a gasp
she pants upon the passionate lips that ache
with the red drain of her own mouth and make
a monochord of colour like an asp
one lithe lock wriggles in his rutilant grasp
her bosom is an oven of myrrh to bake
love's white warm shewbread to a browner cake
the lock his fingers clench has burst its hasp
the legs are absolutely abominable
ah what keen overgust of wild eyed woes
flags in that bosom flushes in that nose
nay death sets riddles for desire to spell
responsive what red hem earth's passion sews
but may be ravenously untripped in hell
lying asleep between the strokes of night
i saw my love lean over my sad bed
pale as the duskiest lily's leaf or head
smooth skinned and dark with bare throat made to bite
too wan for blushing and too warm for white
but perfect colored without white or red
and her lips opened amorously and said
i wist not what saving one word  delight
and all her face was honey to my mouth
and all her body pasture to mine eyes
the long lithe arms and hotter hands than fire
the quivering flanks hair smelling of the south
the bright light feet the splendid supple thighs
and glittering eyelids of my soul's desire
beneath the shadow of dawn's aeumlrial cope
with eyes enkindled as the sun's own sphere
hope from the front of youth in godlike cheer
looks godward past the shades where blind men grope
round the dark door that prayers nor dreams can ope
and makes for joy the very darkness dear
that gives her wide wings play nor dreams that fear
at noon may rise and pierce the heart of hope
then when the soul leaves off to dream and yearn
may truth first purge her eyesight to discern
what once being known leaves time no power to appall
till yoiuth at last ere yet youth be not learn
the kind wise word that falls from years that fall
hope thou not much and fear thou not at all
two souls diverse out of our human sight
pass followed one with love and each with wonder
the stormy sophist with his mouth of thunder
clothed with loud words and mantled in the might
of darkness and magnificence of night
and one whose eye could smite the night in sunder
searching if light or no light were thereunder
and found in love of loving kindness light
duty divine and thought with eyes of fire
still following righteousness with deep desire
shone sole and stern before her and above
sure stars and sole to steer by but more sweet
shone lower the loveliest lamp for earthly feet
the light of little children and their love
chief in thy generation born of men
whom english praise acclaimed as english born
with eyes that matched the worldwide eyes of morn
for gleam of tears or laughter tenderest then
when thoughts of children warmed their light or when
reverence of age with love and labor worn
or godlike pity fired with godlike scorn
shot through them flame that winged thy swift live pen
where stars and suns that we behold not burn
higher even thatn here though highest was here thy place
love sees thy spirit laugh and speak and shine
with shakespeare and the soft bright sould of sterne
and fielding's kindliest might and goldsmith's grace
scarce one more loved or worthier love than thine
o son of man by lying tongues adored
by slaughterous hands of slaves with feet red shod
in carnage deep as ever christian trod
profaned with prayer and sacrifice abhorred
and incense from the trembling tyrant's horde
brute worshippers of wielders of the rod
most murderous even of all that call thee god
most treacherous even that ever called thee lord
face loved of little children long ago
head hated of the priests and rulers then
if thou see this or hear these hounds of thine
run ravening as the gadarean swine
say was not this thy passion to foreknow
in death's worst hour the works of christian men
crowned girdled garbed and shod with light and fire
son first born of the morning sovereign star
soul nearest ours of all that wert most far
most far off in the abysm of time thy lyre
hung highest above the dawn enkindled quire
where all ye sang together all that are
and all the starry songs behind thy car
rang sequence all our souls acclaim thee sire
if all the pens that ever poets held
had fed the feeling of their masters' thoughts
and as with rush of hurtling chariots
the flight of all their spirits were impelled
toward one great end thy glory  nay not then
not yet might'st thou be praised enough of men
not if men's tongues and angels' all in one
spake might the word be said that might speak thee
streams winds woods flowers fields mountains yea the sea
what power is in them all to praise the sun
his praise is this  he can be praised of none
man woman child praise god for him but he
exults not to be worshiped but to be
he is and being beholds his work well done
all joy all glory all sorrow all strength all mirth
are his without him day were night on earth
time knows not his from time's own period
all lutes all harps all viols all flutes all lyres
fall dumb before him ere one string suspires
all stars are angels but the sun is god
broad based broad fronted bounteous multiform
with many a valley impleached with ivy and vine
wherein the springs of all the streams run wine
and many a crag full faced against the storm
the mountain where thy muse's feet made warm
those lawns that reveled with her dance divine
shines yet with fire as it was wont to shine
from tossing torches round the dance aswarm
nor less high stationed on the gray grave heights
high thoughted seers with heaven's heart kindling lights
hold converse and the herd of meaner things
knows or by fiery scourge or fiery shaft
when wrath on thy broad brows has risen and laughed
darkening thy soul with shadow of thunderous wings
an hour ere sudden sunset fired the west
arose two stars upon the pale deep east
the hall of heaven was clear for night's high feast
yet was not yet day's fiery heart at rest
love leapt up from his mother's burning breast
to see those warm twin lights as day decreased
wax wider till when all the sun had ceased
as suns they shone from evening's kindled crest
across them and between a quickening fire
flamed venus laughing with appeased desire
their dawn scarce lovelier for the gleam of tears
filled half the hollow shell 'twixt heaven and earth
with sound like moonlight mingling moan and mirth
which rings and glitters down the darkling years
hew hard the marble from the mountain's heart
where hardest night holds fast in iron gloom
gems brighter than an april dawn in bloom
that his memnonian likeness thence may start
revealed whose hand with high funereal art
carved night and chiselled shadow be the tomb
that speaks him famous graven with signs of doom
intrenched inevitably in lines athwart
as on some thunder blasted titan's brow
his record of rebellion not the day
shall strike forth music from so stern a chord
touching this marble darkness none knows how
and stars impenetrable of midnight may
so looms the likeness of thy soul john ford
thunder the flesh quails and the soul bows down
night east west south and northward very night
star upon struggling star strives into sight
star after shuddering star the deep storms drown
the very throne of night her very crown
a man lays hand on and usurps her right
song from the highest of heaven's imperious height
shoots as a fire to smite some towering town
rage anguish harrowing fear heart crazing crime
make monstrous all the murderous face of time
shown in the spheral orbit of a glass
revolving earth cries out from all her graves
frail on frail rafts across wide wallowing waves
shapes here and there of child and mother pass
greene garlanded with february's few flowers
ere march came in with marlowe's rapturous rage
peele from whose hand the sweet white locks of age
took the mild chaplet woven of honored hours
nash laughing hard lodge flushed from lyric bowers
and lilly a goldfinch in a twisted cage
fed by some gay great lady's pettish page
till short sweet songs gush clear like short spring showers
kid whose grim sport still gamboled over graves
and chettle in whose fresh funereal verse
weeps marian yet on robin's wildwood hearse
cooke whose light boat of song one soft breath saves
sighed from a maiden's amorous mouth averse
live likewise ye  time takes not you for slaves
were i as base as is the lowly plain
and you my love as high as heaven above
yet should the thoughts of me your humble swain
ascend to heaven in honor of my love
were i as high as heaven above plain
and you my love as humble and as low
as are the deepest bottoms of the main
wheresoe'er you were with you my love shouuld go
were you the earth dear love and i the skies
my love should shine on you like to the sun
and look upon you with ten thousand eyes
till heaven waxed blind and till the world were dun
wheresoe'er i am below or else above you
wheresoe'er you are my heart shall truly love you
they say that shadows of deceased ghosts
do haunt the houses and the graves about
of such whose life's lamp went untimely out
delighting still in their forsaken hosts
so in the place where cruel love doth shoot
the fatal shaft that slew my love's delight
i stalk and walk and wander day and night
even like a ghost with unperceived foot
but those light ghosts are happier far than i
for at their pleasure they can come and go
unto the place that hides their treasure so
and see the name with their fantastic eye
where i alas dare not approach the cruel
proud moment that doth enclose my jewel
no moon now blushes on the enamoured sight
no genial sun now warms the torpid lay
since february sternly checked his ray
when lucy's eyes first beamed their azure light
what though no vernal flowers my hand invite
to crop their fragrance for your natal day
lucy for you the snowdrop and the bay
shall blend the unfading green and modest white
though on your natal day with aspect bleak
stern winter frown in icy garments dressed
still may the rosy summer robe your cheek
and the green spring still bud within your breast
till the world fading on your closing eyes
you find a golden autumn in the skies
the sonnet is a world where feelings caught
in webs of phantasy combine and fuse
their kindred elements 'neath mystic dews
shed from the ether round man's dwelling wrought
distilling heart's content star fragrance fraught
with influences from the breathing fires
of heaven in everlasting endless gyres
ending and encircling orbs of thought
our sonnet's world hath two fix'd hemispheres
this where the sun with fierce strength masculine
pours his keen rays and bids the noonday shine
that where the moon and the stars concordant powers
shed milder rays and daylight disappears
in low melodious music of still hours
nay death thou art a shadow even as light
is but the shadow of invisible god
and of that shade the shadow is thin night
veiling the earth whereon our feet have trod
so art thou but the shadow of this life
itself the pale and unsubstantial shade
of living god fulfill'd by love and strife
throughout the universe himself hath made
and as frail night following the flight of earth
obscures the world we breathe in for a while
so thou the reflex of our mortal birth
veilest the life wherein we weep and smile
but when both earth and life are whirl'd away
what shade can shroud us from god's deathess day
there are who when the bat on wing transverse
skims the swart surface of some neighbouring mere
catch that thin cry too fine for common ear
thus the last joy note of the universe
is borne to those few listners who immerse
their intellectual hearing in no clear
paean but pierce it with the thin edged spear
of utmost beauty which contains a curse
dead on their sense fall marches hymeneal
triumphal odes hymns symphonies sonorous
they crave one shrill vibration tense ideal
transcending and surpassing the world's chorus
keen fine ethereal exquisitely real
intangible as star's light quivering o'er us
all that began with god in god must end
all lives are garnered in his final bliss
all wills hereafter shall be one with his
when in the sea we sought our spirits blend
rays of pure light which one frail prism may rend
into conflicting colours meet and kiss
with manifold attraction yet still miss
contentment while their kindred hues contend
break but that three edged glass  inviolate
the sundered beams resume their primal state
weaving pure light in flawless harmony
thus decomposed subject to love and strife
god's thought made conscious through man's mortal life
resumes through death the eternal unity
lift up your headds gates of my heart unfold
your portals to salute the king of kings
behold him come borne on cherubic wings
engrained with crimson eyes and grail of gold
before his path the thunder clouds withhold
their stormy pinions and the desert sings
he from his lips divine and forehead flings
sunlight of peace unfathomed bliss untold
o soul faint soul disquieted how long
lift up thine eyes for lo thy lord is near
lord of all loveliness and strength and song
the lord who brings heart sadness better cheer
scattering those midnight dreams that dote on wrong
purging with heaven's pure rays love's atmosphere
the cross the cross is tainted o most just
be merciful and save me from this snare
the tempter lures me as i bend in prayer
before the sacred symbol of our trust
yea the most holy of holies feeds my lust
the body of thy christ for unaware
even as i kneel and pray lo she is there
the temptress she the wanton and she hath thrust
the christ's bruised body off and all her own
shameless she stretches on the cross arms wide
limbs pendent in libidinous mockery
she draws mine eyes to hersmdashah sin unknown
she smiles she triumphs but the crucified
falls off into the darkness with a cry
i will arise and leave these haggard realms
the nether fire's breath spots the rusty grass
the insatiate hunger of the blight o'erwhelms
the lean year's barren promise let me pass
o woman from the hold of hell and thee
what have i done that thou should'st hold me so
in love's name loosen me and set me free
if not for love in pity let me go
why should i linger for the land is bare
and wings of famine labour up the wind
already i have wasted all my share
of living bread the husks remain behind
husks that the swine do eat and must i wait
weary and famished fallen and desolate
she lies upon the cold stone of her cell
and the night deepens and the night is chill
fasting and faint she nerves her flagging will
remembering the inevitable hell
yet still her lover's voice she hears too well
and love love love she hears and answers still
the christ looms high against an angry hill
her heart and love would roam a lowly dell
fasting and faint she lies the shepherd night
leads the calm stars across his plains like sheep
earth slumbers when shall slumber seal her eyes
who crying with lamentations infinite
heaven heaven yet ineradicably deep
hides in her heart an alien paradise
gently i wave the visible world away
far off i hear a roar afar yet near
far off and strange a voice is in my ear
and is the voice my own the words i say
fall strangely like a dream across the day
and the dim sunshine is a dream how clear
new as the world to lovers' eyes appear
the men and women passing on their way
the world is very fair the hours are all
linked in a dance of mere forgetfulness
i am at peace with god and man o glide
sands of the hour glass that i count not fall
serenely scarce i feel your soft caress
rocked on this dreamy and indifferent tide
the modern malady of love is nerves
love once a simple madness now observes
the stages of his passionate disease
and is twice sorrowful because he sees
inch by inch entering the fatal knife
o health of simple minds give me your life
and let me for one midnight cease to hear
the clock for ever ticking in my ear
the clock that tells the minutes in my brain
it is not love nor love's despair this pain
that shoots a witless keener pang across
the simple agony of love and loss
nerves nerves o folly of a child who dreams
of heaven and waking in the darkness screams
a year ago i asked you for your soul
i took it in my hands it weighed as light
as any bird's wing it was poised for flight
it was a wandering thing without a goal
i caged it and i tended it it throve
wise ways i taught it it forgot to fly
it learnt to know its cage its keeper i
its keeper taught it that the cage was love
and now i take my bird out of the cage
it flutters not a feather looks at me
sadly without desire without surprise
see i have tamed it it is still and sage
it has not strength enough for liberty
it does not even hate me with its eyes
i see them in my dreams their tiny hands
clutch feebly at the air upon my face
blows their sweet breath a little voice demands
my eager kisses in that soft embrace
a sense of aching though i know not why
a sense of some forgotten longed for joy
a joy that thrills me through yet makes me sigh
that time could never change nor death destroy
still in my dreams i clasp them to my breast
their soft warm presence folded close to mine
and o'er me steals the balm of perfect rest
and through my veins a gladness like to wine
i murmur shiver  then as cold as stone
awake  and oh dear god awake alone
the storm is spent the wind has died away
cool raindrops cling to trembling leaf and tree
as one departing lingers  loath to stay
and yet departing more unwillingly
the clouds have vanished from the purpled sky
before the footsteps of the rising moon
the queen whose jewelled courtiers prostrate lie
dazed by the splendour of her silvered shoon
the earth beneath half hidden half revealed
breathes mellowed beauty where each faery beam
bathes kloof and vlei and kraal and mealie field
and willows swaying sadly o'er a stream
in light  wherein a mining shaft may seem
the angel's ladder of a poet's dream
no breath of air the fingers of the sun
have touched a panting world with lambent fire
and now the earth and heavens wrapped in one
deep gloom with dread await what both desire
the eager wind comes sweeping through the street
and atoms gathered here and scattered there
are drawn again together till they meet
and twisting strangely in the yellow glare
assume unhallowed shapes a hush a thrill
foretell great happenings and by and by
a sudden blinding light  and all is still
a crash  so might a titan roar and die
then sweet as sleep that lulls persistent pain
in ever swelling cadence falls the rain
the dim grey light comes stealing and the stars
melt swiftly till at last the only one
is left a watcher rosy radiant bars
of cloud foretell a day not yet begun
the purple sky pales in the waking east
from blue to faintest green the mountains stand
on the horizon's edge each bird and beast
stirs in its sleep a hush is o'er the land
the light grows brighter trees and shrubs appear
like wraiths that beckon dumbly in the gloom
mysterious shapes that slowly grow more clear
then  chirping birds and flowers all a bloom
and lo the sun  wielding a molten spear
leaps like a god new risen from his tomb
with no cold admiration do i gaze
upon thy pomp of waters matchless stream
but home sick fancy kindles with the beam
that on thy lucid bosom coyly plays
and glides delighted through thy crystal ways
till on her eye those wave fed poplars gleam
beneath whose shade her first etherial maze
she fashioned where she traced in clearest dream
thy mirrored curse of wood enshrined repose
besprent with island haunts of spirits bright
and widening on  till at the vision's close
great london only then a name of might
for childish thought to build on proudly rose
a rock throned city clad in heavenly light
where should the poet's house and household be
beneath what skies in what untroubled air
sings he for very joy of songs so fair
that in their steadfast laws he most is free
in woods remote where darkly tree on tree
let fall their curtained shadows to ensnare
his dreams or hid in fancy's happiest lair
some laughing island of the stormless sea
ah never such to him their welcome gave
but flattered by the gods in finer scorn
he drifts upon the world's unresting wave
as drifts a sea flower by the tempest torn
from sheltered porches of the coral cave
where it expands of calm and silence born
absence from thee is something worse than death
for to the heart that slumbers in the shroud
what are the mourners' tears and clamours loud
the open grave the dismal cypress wreath
the quiet body misses not its breath
the pain that shivers through the weeping crowd
is idle homage to the visage proud
that changeth not for all affliction saith
but to be thus from thee so far away
is as though i in seeming death might be
conscious of all that passed about my clay
as though i saw my doleful obsequy
mourned my own loss rebelled against decay
and felt thy tear drops trickling over me
once more without you  sighing dear once more
for all the sweet accustomed ministries
of wife and mother not as when the seas
that parted us my tender message bore
from the gray olives of the cretan shore
to those that hide the broken phidian frieze
of our athenian home  but far degrees
wide plains great forests part us now  my door
looks on the rushing neva cold and clear
the swelling domes in hovering splendour lie
like golden bubbles eager to be gone
but the chill crystal of the atmosphere
withholds them and along the northern sky
the amber midnight smiles in dreams of dawn
sweet semi circled cynthia played at maw
the whilst endymion ran the wild goose chase
great bacchus with his cross bow killed a daw
and sullen saturn smiled with pleasant face
the ninefold bugbears of the caspian lake
sat whistling ebon hornpipes to their ducks
madge owlet straight for joy her girdle brake
and rugged satyrs frisked like stags and bucks
the untamed tumbling fifteen footed goat
with promulgation of the lesbian shores
confronted hydra in a sculler boat
at which the mighty mountain taurus roars
meantime great sultan soliman was born
and atlas blew his rustic rumbling horn
if i were loved as i desire to be
what is there in the great sphere of the earth
and range of evil between death and birth
that i should fear  if i were loved by thee
all the inner all the outer world of pain
clear love would pierce and cleave if thou wert mine
as i have heard that somewhere in the main
fresh water springs come up through bitter brine
't were joy not fear claspt hand in hand with thee
to wait for death  mute  careless of all ills
apart upon a mountain tho' the surge
of some new deluge from a thousand hills
flung leagues of roaring foam into the gorge
below us as far on as eye could see
old poets foster'd under friendlier skies
old virgil who would write ten lines they say
at dawn and lavish all the golden day
to make them wealthier in the readers' eyes
and you old popular horace you the wise
adviser of the nine years ponder'd lay
and you that wear a wreath of sweeter bay
catullus whose dead songster never dies
if glancing downward on the kindly sphere
that once had roll'd you round and round the sun
you see your art still shrined in human shelves
you should be jubilant that you flourish'd here
before the love of letters overdone
had swamped the sacred poets with themselves
he thought to quell the stubborn hearts of oak
madman to chain with chains and bind with bands
that island queen who sways the floods and lands
from ind to ind but in fair daylight woke
when from her wooden walls  lit by sure hands
with thunders and with lightnings and with smoke
peal after peal the british battle broke
lulling the brine against the coptic sands
we taught him lkowlier moods when elsinore
heard the war moan along the distant sea
rocking with shattered spars with sudden fires
flamed over at trafalgar yet once more
we taught him late he learned humility
perforce like those whom gideon schooled with briars
what time the mighty moon was gathering light
love paced the thymy plots of paradise
and all about him rolled his lustrous eyes
when turning round a cassia full in view
death walking all alone beneath a yew
and talking to himself first met his sight
you must begone said death these walks are mine
love wept and spread his sheeny vans for flight
yet ere he parted said this hour is thine
thou art the shadow of life and as the tree
stands in the sun and shadows all beneath
so in the light of great eternity
life eminent creates the shade of death
the shadow passeth when the tree shall fall
but i shall reign for ever over all
then what is life i cried from his rent deeps
of soul the poet cast that burning word
and it should seem as though his prayer was heard
for he died soon and now his rest he keeps
somewhere with the great spirit who never sleeps
he had left us to murmur on awhile
and question still most fruitlessly this pile
of natural shows what life is why man weeps
why sins  and whither when the awful veil
floats on to him he sinks from earthly sight
some are who never grow a whit more pale
for thinking on the general mystery
ground of all being yet may i rather be
of those who know and feel that it is night
it comes  the awful hour  compatriots dear
who oft confiding in my honest zeal
and keen attachments to the public weal
bent to my artless theme the partial ear
now search my breast with scrutiny severe
that breast which frequent in the swelling pride
of youthful ardour the stern threats defied
of distant danger
mark if now base fear
palsy its boasted future  or if now
forgetful of the truths so oft upheld
abject beneath the imperious foot i bow
of terror vested power  suppliant  depressed
or one emotion feel but what the breast
of hampden or of sidney might have swelled
how far ye nymphs and dryads must we stray
beyond your once loved haunts ere we again
may meet you in your freshness my young day
has oft time seen me in your sylvan train
culling the wild wood flowers where now remain
nor brake nor hedgerow nor clear bubbling stream
to feed their fragrance or the fervid ray
to mitigate but to the flaunting beam
the domes of tasteless opulence display
shadeless their glaring fronts while the pure rill
that wont to parley or by noon or night
with phoebus' or with dian's softer light
now through some drain obscene creeps dark and still
to sweep the waste of luxury away
why are your songs all wild and bitter sad
as funeral dirges with the orphans' cries
each night since first the world was made hath had
a sequent day to laugh it down the skies
chant us a glee to make our hearts rejoice
or seal in silence this unmanly moan
my friend i have no power to rule my voice
a spirit lifts me where i lie alone
and thrills me into song by its own laws
that which i feel but seldom know indeed
tempering the melody it could not cause
the bleeding heart cannot forever bleed
inwardly solely on the wan lips too
dark blood will bubble ghastly into view
striving to sing glad songs i but attain
wild discords sadder than grief's saddest tune
as if an owl with his harsh screech should strain
to over gratulate a thrush of june
the nightingale upon its thorny spray
finds inspiration in the sullen dark
the kindling dawn the world wide joyous day
are inspiration to the soaring lark
the seas are silent in the sunny calm
their anthem surges in the tempest boom
the skies outroll no solemn thunder psalm
till they have clothed themselves with clouds of gloom
my mirth can laugh and talk but cannot sing
my grief finds harmonies in everything
the church stands there beyond the orchard blooms
how yearningly i gaze upon its spire
lifted mysterious through the twilight glooms
dissolving in the sunset's golden fire
or dim as slender incense morn by morn
ascending to the blue and open sky
for ever when my heart feels most forlorn
it murmurs to me with a weary sigh
how sweet to enter in to kneel and pray
with all the others whom we love so well
all disbelief and doubt might pass away
all peace float to us with its sabbath bell
conscience replies there is but one good rest
whose head is pillowed upon truth's pure breast
beauty and joy live through the summer day
the morning rustles by my bed of dreams
in garments made of woven auroral beams
and toying zephyrs in the garden stray
shaking the dews from each rose weighted spray
upon the crimson poppies burning lips
a white winged butterfly delighted sips
of cooling golden wine his thirst to allay
the while he poises on the yellow brim
of buttercups and when the day is dim
and shadows flutter in the rising gale
and oak leaves tremble in the wood afar
like falling flakes of gold  o'er night's dark rail
pale seraphs lean each with a censer star
a truce with cares and labours i have cried
and traced the sweet winds to the barley field
to watch the strong browned reapers joyous wield
their curved and twinkling sickles side by side
and where the harvest valley opened wide
a breeze fell down among the rip'ning grain
driving the golden waves across the plain
and dipping in the nooks where fieldlarks hide
brave with its gambol still it went until
it waved the loosestrifes' ribbons o'er the hill
and spilled the dazzling sunset from the flow'rs
within a forest then it hid at night
to waken when the morning filled the bow'rs
with fragrance and with floods of violet light
it is a strange thing but an excellent
that virtue with delight is seldom wed
for still it happens that some accident
doth keep the excelling stranger from her bed
so think i that the elements combine
against the occurrence of such blissful woe
nor ever are the planets now in trine
to make soft light upon this meeting flow
ah me the armour that achilles wore
was made with sweat and with a toiling brow
and worn with sweat and of all love forlore
as ever in this age we find it now
who thinks to rise above his equal peers
must yield to death after long toilsome years
sometimes upon the hills in thought i stand
and travel on the wings of fantasy
with what delight the globeacuted earth is spanned
with how soft foot the wingeacuted moments fly
a silent dream environs me around
i am not what i am i am not here
but yet i walk upon my wonted ground
but yet the woods unto my sight appear
the woods in which from morn till mournful eve
i wander and would shroud myself from day
and envy even the fox whom caves receive
and fast secure him from the glaring ray
this body and machine indeed is here
but flies my soul into a higher sphere
it is much immortal beauty to admire
but more immortal beauty to withstand
the perfect soul can overcome desire
if beauty with divine delight be scanned
for what is beauty but the blooming child
of fair olympus that in night must end
and be for ever from that bliss exiled
if admiration stand too much its friend
the wind may be enamoured of a flower
the ocean of the green and laughing shore
the silver lightning of a lofty tower
but must not with too near a love adore
or flower and margin and cloud capped tower
love and delight shall with delight devour
o tunbridge i approach thee with delight
that hast from many streams thy lovely name
thy hop gardens are blooming to the sight
thy orchards of rich growth are dear to fame
not in all kent in wealthy kent is found
a vale more beauteous to the farmer's eye
meads that with wheat and barley more abound
or a more growth of luscious grass supply
thy castle on the silent medway stands
and mournfully overlooks the laughing town
but thy fair school upbuilt by pious hands
demands the poet's lays and verdant crown
there virgil and great homer well are taught
virtue well prized and evil set at nought
the ruddy purpled day in light retires
the shrieking owlets wanton in the air
and others hoot to see the rising fires
of hesperus exalt their glory fair
the cattle low from out their stabled yard
from house to house the chiding dog is heard
and now the hamlets that have laboured hard
the live long day have their sweet toil deferred
above the moon her silver orbit wheels
with pale delight like fitful tragedy
and to the shepherd his damp path reveals
that to the longing arms of madge doth hie
in cities now they play great scenes to kings
whilst here muse i and think of deeper things
poet if on a lasting fame be bent
thy unperturbing hopes thou will not roam
too far from thine own happy heart and home
cling to the lowly earth and be content
so shall thy name be dear to many a heart
so shall the noblest truths by thee be taught
the flower and fruit of wholesome human thought
bless the sweet labors of thy gentle art
the brightest stars are nearest to the earth
and we may track the mighty sun above
even by the shadow of a slender flower
always o bard humility is power
and thou mayst draw from matters of the hearth
truths wide as nations and as deep as love
most men know love but as a part of life
they hide it in some corner of the breast
even from themselves and only when they rest
in the brief pauses of that daily strife
wherewith the world might else be not so rife
they draw it forth as one draws forth a toy
to soothe some ardent kiss exacting boy
and hold it up to sister child or wife
ah me why may not love and life be one
why walk we thus alone when by our side
love like a visible god might be our guide
how would the marts grow noble and the street
worn like a dungeon floor by weary feet
seem then a golden court way of the sun
life ever seems as from its present site
it aimed to lure us  mountains of the past
it melts with all their crags and caverns vast
into a purple cloud  across the night
which hides what is to be it shoots a light
all rosy with the yet unrisen dawn
not the near daisies but yon distant height
attracts us lying on this emerald lawn
and always be the landscape what it may
blue misty hill or sweep of glimmering plain
it is the eye's endeavor still to gain
the fine faint limit of the bounding day
god haply in this mystic mode would fain
hint of a happier home far far away
they dub thee idler smiling sneeringly
and why because forsooth so many moons
here dwelling voiceless by the voiceful sea
thou hast not set thy thoughts to paltry tunes
in song or sonnet  them these golden noons
oppress not with their beauty they could prate
even while a prophet read the solemn runes
on which is hanging some imperial fate
how know they these good gossips what to thee
the ocean and its wanderers may have brought
how know they in their busy vacancy
with what far aim thy spirit may be fraught
or that thou dost not bow thee silently
before some great unutterable thought
some truths there be are better left unsaid
much is there that we may not speak unblamed
on words as wings how many joys have fled
the jealous fairies love not to be named
there is an old world tale of one whose bed
a genius graced to all save him unknown
one day the secret passed his lips and sped
as secrets speed    thenceforth he slept alone
too much oh far too much is told in books
too broad a daylight wraps us all and each
ah it is well that deeper than our looks
some secrets lie beyond conjecture's reach
ah it is well that in the soul are nooks
that will not open to the keys of speech
i scarcely grieve o nature at the lot
that pent my life within a city's bounds
and shut me from thy sweetest sights and sounds
perhaps i had not learned if some lone cot
had nursed a dreamy childhood what the mart
taught me amid its turmoil so my youth
had missed full many a stern but wholesome truth
here too o nature in this haunt of art
thy power is on me and i own thy thrall
there is no unimpressive spot on earth
the beauty of the stars is over all
and day and darkness visit every hearth
clouds do not scorn us  yonder factory's smoke
looked like a golden mist when morning broke
grief dies like joy the tears upon my cheek
will disappear like dew  dear god i know
thy kindly providence hath made it so
and thank thee for the law  i am too weak
to make a friend of sorrow or to wear
with that dark angel ever by my side
though to thy heaven there be no better guide
a front of manly calm  yet for i hear
how woe hath cleansed how grief can deify
so weak a thing it seems that grief should die
and love and friendship with it i could pray
that if it might not gloom upon my brow
nor weigh upon my arm as it doth now
no grief of mine should ever pass away
at last beloved nature i have met
thee face to face upon thy breezy hills
and boldly where thy inmost bowers are set
gazed on thee naked in thy mountain rills
when first i felt thy breath upon my brow
tears of strange ecstasy gushed out like rain
and with a longing passionate as vain
i strove to clasp thee  but i know not how
always before me didst thou seem to glide
and often from one sunny mountain side
upon the next bright peak i saw thee kneel
and heard thy voice upon the billowy blast
but climbing only reached that shrine to feel
the shadow of a presence which had passed
i know not why but all this weary day
suggested by no definite grief or pain
sad fancies have been flitting through my brain
now it has been a vessel losing way
rounding a stormy headland now a gray
dull waste of clouds above a wintry main
and then a banner drooping in the rain
and meadows beaten into bloody clay
strolling at random with this shadowy woe
at heart i chanced to wander hither  lo
a league of desolate marsh land with its lush
hot grasses in a noisome tide left bed
and faint warm airs that rustle in the hush
like whispers round the body of the dead
were i the poet laureate of the fairies
who in a rose leaf finds too broad a page
or could i like your beautiful canaries
sing with free heart and happy in a cage
perhaps i might within this little space
as in some eastern tale by magic power
a giant is imprisoned in a flower
have told you something with a poet's grace
but i need wider limits ampler scope
a world of freedom for a world of passion
and even then the glory of my hope
would not be uttered in its stateliest fashion
yet lady when fit language shall have told it
you'll find one little heart enough to hold it
which are the clouds and which the mountains  see
they mix and melt together  yon blue hill
looks fleeting as the vapors which distill
their dews upon its summit while the free
and far off clouds now solid dark and still
an aspect wear of calm eternity
each seems the other as our fancies will
the cloud a mount the mount a cloud and we
gaze doubtfully  so everywhere on earth
this foothold where we stand with slipping feet
the unsubstantial and substantial meet
and we are fooled until made wise by time
is not the obvious lesson something worth
lady or have i wov'n an idle rhyme
what gossamer lures thee now  what hope what name
is on thy lips  what dreams to fruit have grown
thou who hast turned one poet heart to stone
is thine yet burning with its seraph flame
let me give back a warning of thine own
that falling from thee many moons ago
sank on my soul like the prophetic moan
of some young sibyl shadowing her own woe
the words are thine and will not do thee wrong
i only bind their solemn charge to song
thy tread is on a quicksand    oh be wise
nor in the passionate eagerness of youth
mistake thy bosom serpent's glittering eyes
for the calm lights of reason and of truth
i thank you kind and best belovegraved friend
with the same thanks one murmurs to a sister
when for some gentle favor he hath kissed her
less for the gifts than for the love you send
less for the flowers than what the flowers convey
if i indeed divine their meaning truly
and not unto myself ascribe unduly
things which you neither meant nor wished to say
oh tell me is the hope then all misplaced
and am i flattered by my own affection
but in your beauteous gift methought i traced
something above a short lived predilection
and which for that i know no dearer name
i designate as love without love's flame
are these wild thoughts thus fettered in my rhymes
indeed the product of my heart and brain
how strange that on my ear the rhythmic strain
falls like faint memories of far off times
when did i feel the sorrow act the part
which i have striv'n to shadow forth in song
in what dead century swept that mingled throng
of mighty pains and pleasures through my heart
not in the yesterdays of that still life
which i have passed so free and far from strife
but somewhere in this weary world i know
in some strange land beneath some orient clime
i saw or shared a martyrdom sublime
and felt a deeper grief than any later woe
if i have graced no single song of mine
with thy sweet name they all are full of thee
thou art my muse my may my madeline
but julia    ah that gentle name to me
is something far too sacred for the throng
of worldly listeners 'round me  yet ev'n now
i weave a chaplet for thy sinless brow
wilt thou not wear it  't is a fashionable song
i will not say of what    but on it i
have wreaked heart mind my love my hopes of fame
yet after all it hath no nobler aim
than thy dear praise  ere many moons pass by
when the lost gem is set the crown complete
i'll lay a poet's tribute at thy feet
the very spirit of summer breathes to day
here where i sun me in a dreamy mood
and laps the sultry leas and seems to brood
tenderly o'er those hazed hills far away
the air is fragrant with the new mown hay
and drowsed with hum of myriad flies pursued
by twittering martins all yon hillside wood
is drowned in sunshine till its green looks grey
no scrap of cloud is in the still blue sky
vaporous with heat from which the foreground trees
stand out  each leaf cut sharp the whetted scythe
makes rustic music for me as i lie
watching the gambols of the children blythe
drinking the season's sweetness to the lees
what means this mighty chant wherein its wail
of some intolerable woe grown strong
with sense of more intolerable wrong
swells to a stern victorious march  a gale
of vengeful wrath what mean the faces pale
the fierce resolve the ecstatic pangs along
life's fiery ways the demon thoughts which throng
the gates of awe when these wild notes assail
the sleeping of our souls  hear ye no more
than the mad foam of revolution's leaven
than a roused people's throne o'erwhelming tread
hark 'tis man's spirit thundering on the shore
of iron fate the tramp of titans dread
sworn to dethrone the gods unjust from heaven
tossed from the falconer's hand in graceful flight
of sweeping circles see the hawk arise
in joyful grandeur to her native skies
her bells quick rattling from her airy height
while over the head of lady and of knight
she sails majestic watchful of the prey
with dogs and hunters and the field's array
noble associate fearful the delight
how ardent and how spiritual made
by her mysterious presence we attend
on no dull moving earthiy power for aid
a hovering being of the skies our friend
so over the isle his wand the enchanter swayed
proud on his faithful ariel to depend
i stood beside a pool from whence ascended
mounting the cloudy platforms of the wind
a stately heron its soaring i attended
till it grew dim and i with watching blind
when lo a shaft of arrowy light descended
upon its darkness and its dim attire
it straightway kindled them and was afire
and with the unconsuming radiance blended
and bird a cloud flecking the sunny air
it had its golden dwelling 'mid the lightning
of those empyreal domes and it might there
have dwelt for ever glorified and bright'ning
but that its wings were weak  so it became
a dusky speck again that was a winged flame
our course is onward onward into light
what though the darkness gathereth amain
yet to return or tarry both are vain
how tarry when around us is thick night
whither return what flower yet ever might
in days of gloom and cold and stormy rain
enclose itself in its green bud again
hiding from wrath of tempest out of sight
courage  we travel through a darksome cave
but still as nearer to the light we draw
fresh gales will reach us from the upper air
and wholesome dews of heaven our foreheads lave
the darkness lighten more till full of awe
we stand in the open sunshine unaware
a sound of many waters  now i know
to what was likened the large utterance sent
by him who mid the golden lampads went
innumerable streams above below
some seen some heard alone with headlong flow
come rushing some with smooth and sheer descent
some dashed to foam and whiteness but all blent
into one mighty music
as i go
the tumult of a boundless gladness fills
my bosom and my spirit leaps and sings
sounds and sights are there of the ancient hills
the eagle's cry the mountain when it flings
mists from its brow but none of all these things
like the one voice of multitudinous rills
dank fens of cedar hemlock branches gray
with tress and trail of mosses wringing wet
beds of the black pitch pine in dead leaves set
whose wasted red has wasted to white away
remnants of rain and droppings of decay
why hold ye so my heart nor dimly let
through your deep leaves the light of yesterday
the faded glimmer of a sunshine set
is it that in your darkness shut from strife
the bread of tears becomes the bread of life
far from the roar of day beneath your boughs
fresh griefs beat tranquilly and loves and vows
grow green in your gray shadows dearer far
even than all lovely lights and roses are
an upper chamber in a darkened house
where ere his footsteps reached ripe manhood's brink
terror and anguish were his cup to drink
i cannot rid the thought nor hold it close
but dimly dream upon that man alone
now though the autumn clouds most softly pass
the cricket chides beneath the doorstep stone
and greener than the season grows the grass
nor can i drop my lids nor shade my brows
but there he stands beside the lifted sash
and with a swooning of the heart i think
where the black shingles slope to meet the boughs
and  shattered on the roof like smallest snows
the tiny petals of the mountain ash
his heart was in his garden but his brain
wandered at will among the fiery stars
bards heroes prophets homers hamilcars
with many angels stood his eye to gain
the devils too were his familiars
and yet the cunning florist held his eyes
close to the ground  a tulip bulb his prize
and talked of tan and bone dust cutworms grubs
as though all nature held no higher strain
or if he spoke of art he made the theme
flow through box borders turf and flower tubs
or like a garden engine's steered the stream
now spouted rainbows to the silent skies
now kept it flat and raked the walks and shrubs
under the mountain as when first i knew
its low dark roof and chimney creeper twined
the red house stands and yet my footsteps find
vague in the walks waste balm and fever few
but they are gone no soft eyed sisters trip
across the porch or lintels where behind
the mother sat  sat knitting with pursed lip
the house stands vacant in its green recess
absent of beauty as a broken heart
the wild rain enters and the sunset wind
sighs in the chambers of their loveliness
or shakes the pane and in the silent noons
the glass falls from the window part by part
and ringeth faintly in the grassy stones
thin little leaves of wood fern ribbed and toothed
long curved sail needles of the green pitch pine
with common sandgrass skirt the horizon line
and over these the incorruptible blue
here let me gently lie and softly view
all world asperities lightly touched and smoothed
as by his gracious hand the great bestower
what though the year be late some colors run
yet through the dry some links of melody
still let me be by such assuaged and soothed
and happier made as when our schoolday done
we hunted on from flower to frosty flower
tattered and dim the last red butterfly
or the old grasshopper molasses mouthed
sometimes i walk where the deep water dips
against the land or on where fancy drives
i walk and muse aloud like one who strives
to tell his half shaped thought with stumbling lips
and view the ocean sea the ocean ships
with joyless heart still but myself i find
and restless phantoms of my restless mind
only the moaning of my wandering words
only the wailing of the wheeling plover
and this high rock beneath whose base the sea
has wormed long caverns like my tears in me
and hard like this i stand and beaten and blind
this desolate rock with lichens rusted over
hoar with salt sleet and chalkings of the birds
how like the leper with his own sad cry
enforcing his own solitude it tolls
that lonely bell set in the rushing shoals
to warn us from the place of jeopardy
o friend of man sore vex'd by ocean's power
the changing tides wash o'er thee day by day
thy trembling mouth is fill'd with bitter spray
yet still thou ringest on from hour to hour
high is thy mission though thy lot is wild
to be in danger's realm a guardian sound
in seamen's dreams a pleasant part to bear
and earn their blessing as the year goes round
and strike the keynote of each grateful prayer
breath'd in their distant homes by wife or child
how oft i've watch'd thee from the garden croft
in silence when the busy day was done
shining with wondrous brilliancy aloft
and flickering like a casement 'gainst the sun
i've seen thee soar from out some snowy cloud
which held the frozen breath of land and sea
yet broke and sever'd as the wind grew loud
but earth bound winds could not dismember thee
nor shake thy frame of jewels i have guess'd
at thy strange shape and function haply felt
the charm of that old myth about thy belt
and sword but most my spirit was possess'd
by his great presence who is never far
from his light bearers whether man or star
with joy all relics of the past i hail
the heath bell lingering in our cultured moor
or the dull sound of the slip shouldered flail
still busy on the poor man's threshing floor
i love this unshorn hedgerow which survives
its stunted neighbors in this farming age
the thatch and houseleek where old alice lives
with her old herbal trusting every page
i love the spinning wheel which hums far down
in yon lone valley though from day to day
the boom of science shakes it from the town
ah sweet old world thou speedest fast away
my boyhood's world but all last looks are dear
more touching is the deathbed than the bier
when letty had scarce passed her third glad year
and her young artless words began to flow
one day we gave the child a colored sphere
of the wide earth that she might mark and know
by tint and outline all its sea and land
she patted all the world old empires peeped
between her baby fingers her soft hand
was welcome at all frontiers how she leaped
and laughed and prattled in her world wide bliss
but when we turned her sweet unlearned eye
on our own isle she raised a joyous cry
o yes i see it letty's home is there
and while she hid all england with a kiss
bright over europe fell her golden hair
methought i lived in the icy times forlorn
and with a fond forecasting love and pride
i hung o'er frozen england  when i cried
when will the island of our hopes be born
when will our fields be seen our church bells heard
and avon doon and tweed break out in song
this blank unstoried ice be warmed and stirred
and thames and clyde and humber roll along
to a free sea board airs of paradise
install our summer and our flowery springs
and lift the larks and our land the nightingales
and this wild alien unfamiliar wales
melt home among her harps and vernal skies
thaw out old dover for the houseless kings
in summertime it was a paradise
of mountain frith and bay and shining sand
our outward rowers sang towards the land
followed by waving hands and happy cries
by the full flood the groups no longer roam
and when at ebb the glistening beach grows wide
no barefoot children race into the foam
but passive jellies wait the turn of tide
like some forsaken lover lingering there
the boatman stands the maidens trip no more
with loosened locks far from the billows' roar
the mauds and maries knot their tresses fair
where not a foam flake from th' enamored shore
comes down the sea wind on the golden hair
when the young hand of darnley locked in hers
had knit her to her northern doom  amid
the spousal pomp of flags and trumpeters
her fate looked forth and was no longer hid
a jealous brain beneath a southern crown
wrought spells upon her from afar she felt
the waxen image of her fortunes melt
beneath the tudor's eye while the grim frown
of her own lords o'ermastered her sweet smiles
and nipped her growing gladness till she mourned
and sank at last beneath their cruel wiles
but ever since all generous hearts have burned
to clear her fame yes very babes have yearned
over this saddest story of the isles
flush with the pond the lurid furnace burned
at eve while smoke and vapor filled the yard
the gloomy winter sky was dimly starred
the fly wheel with a mellow murmur turned
while ever rising on its mystic stair
in the dim light from secret chambers borne
the straw of harvest severed from the corn
climbed and fell over in the murky air
i thought of mind and matter will and law
and then of him who set his stately seal
of roman words on all the forms he saw
of old world husbandry i could but feel
with what a rich precision he would draw
the endless ladder and the booming wheel
did any seer of ancient time forbode
this mighty engine which we daily see
accepting our full harvests like a god
with clouds about his shoulders  it might be
some poet husbandman some lord of verse
old hesiod or the wizard mantuan
who catalogued in rich hexameters
the rake the roller and the mystic van
or else some priest of ceres it might seem
who witnessed as he trod the silent fane
the notes and auguries of coming change
of other ministrants in shrine and grange
the sweating statue and her sacred wain
low booming with the prophecy of steam
and this reft house is that the which he built
lamented jack and here his malt he pil'd
cautious in vain these rats that squeak so wild
squeak not unconscious of their father's guilt
did ye not see her gleaming through the glade
belike 't was she the maiden all forlorn
what tho' she the maiden all forlorn
what tho' she milk no cow with crumpled horn
yet aye she haunts the dale where erst she stray'd
and aye beside her stalks her amorous knight
still on his thighs their wonted brogues are worn
and thro' those brogues still tatter'd and betorn
his hindward charms gleam an unearthly white
as when thro' broken clouds at night's high noon
peeps in fair fragments forth the full orb'd harvest moon
child of lubricious art of sanguine sport
of pangful mirth sweet ermin'd sprite
who lov'st with silent velvet step to court
the bashful bosom of the night
whose elfin eyes can pierce night's sable gloom
and witch her fairy prey with guile
who sports fell frolic o'er the grisly tomb
and gracest death with dimpling smile
daughter of ireful mirth sportive in rage
whose joy should shine in sculptur'd bas relief
like patience in rapt shakespeare's deathless page
smiling in marble at wan grief
oh come and teach me all thy barb'rous joy
to sport with sorrow first and then destroy
morning in zululand i was awake
ere yet the sun the voiceless hill tops kissed
far in the distance like a fog dimmed lake
the bosom of a mountain with the mist
hanging above it on its highest hold
a ruin grand in famished wilderness
like some romantic castle tower of old
blue solitary silent tenantless
now decks the sun the eastern sky with gold
now with a golden diadem has crowned
the stately turret awe rapt i behold
his gilded rays the silver mist confound
with longings undefined yet past control
in silent meditation of the soul
out of the mist land of the past come back
and hold my hand in silence smile on me
just once to cheer me on the lonely track
that leads from sorrow to uncertainty
where art thou now ah love how can i say
perchance in some far world i may not see
as many ocean waves have rolled away
as all the years that hide thee far from me
yet i have known thee once full long ago
the evening winds bring echoes of our love
the twilight drooping flowers do tell me so
and the imagined murmuring above
and to my spirit thou art ever real
who wert and art and shalt be mine ideal
as these far reaching sands my life is drear
and mournful as the murmur of the deep
and changeless ocean but they come in sleep
my loving kinsmen from afar and bear
to kindly sleep's dream laden atmosphere
a fond illusion for my heart to keep
like a rich boat gale blown when tides are neap
afraid to lose it holding it so dear
'tis then she comes and with love radiant eyes
and with a little cry she leans on me
and for a moment all my soul swings free
swings free to journey back life's listless stream
but all too soon alas the slumber dies
of one who longs for an eternal dream
farewell my lady and bright star good bye
my soul would find its immortality
my love uncrowneacuted on death's wings would fly
to seek its laurel in eternity
hope softly falls from gardens of the sky
whose soil is darkness and whose blossoms light
falls softly in the murmured melody
borne earthward by the dewy winds of night
o winds that in the kingdom of yon mist
sing to the flowers and all their secrets bear
inform my heart now while the world is kissed
to listless silence dwells contentment there
do loving dreams inhabit that domain
where i would end this flight to dream again
that god should love me is more wonderful
than that i so imperfectly love him
my reason is mortality and dim
senses his  oh insupportable
is that he sees me even when i pull
dark thoughts about my head each vein and limb
delights him though remembrance in him grim
with my worst crimes should prove me horrible
and he has terrors that he can release
but when he looks he loves me which is why
i wonder and my wonder must increase
till more of it shall slay me yet i live
i live and he has never ceased to give
this glance at me that sweetens the whole sky
after long drought commotion in the sky
after dead silence thunder then it comes
the rain it slashes leaves and doubly drums
on tin and shingle beats and bends awry
the flower heads puddles dust and with a sigh
like love sinks into grasses where it hums
as bees did once among chrysanthemums
and asters when the summer thought to die
the whole world dreamed of this and has it now
nor was the waking easy the dull root
is jealous of its death the sleepy brow
smiles in its slumber and a heart can fear
the very flood it longed for roaring near
the spirit best remembers being mute
equality is absolute or no
nothing between can stand we are the sons
of the same sire or madness breaks and runs
through the rude world ridiculous our woe
if single pity does not love it so
our separate fathers love us no man shuns
his poorest child's embrace we are the sons
of such or ground and sky are soon to go
nor do born brothers judge as good or ill
their being each consents and is the same
or suddenly sweet winds turn into flame
and floods are on us  fire earth water air
all hideously parted as his will
withdraws no longer fatherly and there
the deepest dream is of mad governors
down down we feel it till the very crust
of the world cracks and where there was no dust
atoms of ruin rise  confusion stirs
and fear and all our thoughts  dark scavengers
feed on the center's refuse hope is thrust
like wind away and love sinks into lust
for merest safety meanest of levelers
and then we wake or do we sleep endures
more than the morning can when shadows lie
sharper than mountains and the cleft is real
between us and our kings what sun assures
our courage and what evening by and by
descends to rest us and perhaps to heal
still still my eye will gaze long fixed on thee
till i forget that i am called a man
and at thy side fast rooted seem to be
and the breeze comes my cheek with thine to fan
upon this craggy hill our life shall pass
a life of summer days and summer joys
nodding our honey bells mid pliant grass
in which the bee half hid his time employs
and here we'll drink with thirsty pores the rain
and turn dew sprinkled to the rising sun
and look when in the flaming west again
his orb across the heaven its path has run
here left in darkness on the rocky steep
my weary eyes shall close like folding flowers in sleep
the clear bright morning with its scented air
and gaily waving flowers is here again
man's heart is lifted with the voice of prayer
and peace descends as falls the gentle rain
the tuneful birds that all the night have slept
take up at dawn the evening's dying lay
when sleep upon their eyelids gently crept
and stole with stealthy craft their song away
high overhead the forest's swaying boughs
sprinkle with drops the traveler on his way
he hears far off the tinkling bells of cows
driven to pasture at the break of day
with vigorous step he passes swift along
making the woods reecho with his song
the morning comes and thickening clouds prevail
hanging like curtains all the horizon round
or overhead in heavy stillness sail
so still is day it seems like night profound
scarce by the city's din the air is stirred
and dull and deadened comes its every sound
the cock's shrill piercing voice subdued is heard
by the thick folds of muffling vapors drowned
dissolved in mists the hills and trees appear
their outlines lost and blended with the sky
and well known objects that to all are near
no longer seem familiar to the eye
but with fantastic forms they mock the sight
as when we grope amid the gloom of night
the bubbling brook doth leap when i come by
because my feet find measure with its call
the birds know when the friend they love is nigh
for i am known to them both great and small
the flower that on the lonely hillside grows
expects me there when spring its bloom has given
and many a tree and bush my wanderings knows
and e'en the clouds and silent stars of heaven
for he who with his maker walks aright
shall be their lord as adam was before
his ear shall catch each sound with new delight
each object wear the dress that then it wore
and he as when erect in soul he stood
hear from his father's lips that all is good
i saw the spot where our first parents dwelt
and yet it wore to me no face of change
for while amid its fields and groves i felt
as if i had not sinned nor thought it strange
my eye seemed but a part of every sight
my ear heard music in each sound that rose
each sense forever found a new delight
such as the spirit's vision only knows
each act some new and ever varying joy
did by my father's love for me prepare
to dress the spot my ever fresh employ
and in the glorious whole with him to share
no more without the flaming gate to stray
no more for sin's dark stain the debt of death to pay
when i would sing of crooked streams and fields
on on from me they stretch too far and wide
and at their look my song all powerless yields
and down the river bears me with its tide
amid the fields i am a child again
the spots that then i loved i love the more
my fingers drop the strangely scrawling pen
and i remember nought but nature's lore
i plunge me in the river's cooling wave
or on the embroidered bank admiring lean
now some endangered insect life to save
now watch the pictured flowers and grasses green
forever playing where a boy i played
by hill and grove by field and stream delayed
i see them crowd on crowd they walk the earth
dry leafless trees no autumn wind laid bare
and in their nakedness find cause for mirth
and all unclad would winter's rudeness dare
no sap doth through their clattering branches flow
whence springing leaves and blossoms bright appear
their hearts the living god have ceased to know
who gives the spring time to th'expectant year
they mimic life as if from him to steal
his glow of health to paint the livid cheek
they borrow words for thoughts they cannot feel
that with a seeming heart their tongue may speak
and in their show of life more dead they live
than those that to the earth with many tears they give
i read of 'julian' and 'count maddalo'
till in their spirits' presence stood my soul
and blending with their sympathy of woe
a tempest woke my thoughts and they gan roll
billow on billow toward eternity
and passion's cloud hung over the vast sea
where is the essence now that thought and spoke
absorbed like water the frail vessel broke
that held it trembling from the sand awhile
or doth it quiver still and quivering smile
at the now cleared up mystery of creation
which shook it once even to its mortal seat
which seems the brain and heart that burn and beat
till life pants darkly for annihilation
my pierceacuted life was all ablood with sorrow
for suddenly the veil of beauty thrown
by glorifying youth over sweet to morrow
fell and disclosed to me the future's frown
within the wrinkles of whose unread brow
there was a lurking something which till then
i dreamed not hung before the lives of men
ready to fall upon them as they grow
into the longer knowledge of brief years
blank vacancy and doubt and strangled tears
that never reach the eyelids vanishing
of all sweet things we love death beds and graves
and shadowy wrecks where pale hopes trembling cling
heart faint and stifled by continual waves
lady no marvel that the kinsman young
of the grand master of the mystery
of metaphysics fell in love with thee
nor yet that while the stage jumbling along
soothed him to slumber with its one dull song
as towards the land of lakes and poesy
the wayward youth rode nightly journeying  he
over thy imagined form in visions hung
for thou hast charms to warm a colder breast
than that of youthful poet locks like night
cheeks of rich bloom where love hath built his nest
looks like young juno's eyes from whose full glance
the gazer shrinks abashed as in the fight
the polished shield returns the warrior's lance
i looked for thy return beloveacuted spring
as with a sick man's wish i pined for thee
a weak and fretful longing for to me
i thought thy coming would renewal bring
of powers and loves now slowly perishing
thy soft clear sun thy buds on ground and tree
opening the glad tumultuous melody
of thy young birds each new and lovely thing
within my breast the selfsame joy would wake
they waked of old o fond to deem the spell
of outward beauty could have power to make
him happy in whose heart the living well
of happiness is dried thou camest at last
and ere i felt thy presence thou wast past
so thou wouldst tempt me pretty neophyte
me bred in those learneacuted halls whose sons erst broke
with arm polemic rome's usurpeacute yoke
though all unfit to wage  with eyes so bright
and smiles so sweet  the controversial fight
me whom no few as methodist assail
me thou wouldst tempt to quit the happy pale
of england's church to pope and priest my right
of thought resigning
cherish gentle friend
the new found light if light it be and tread
thy clouded path to heaven and let me wend
my way with difficulty sore bested
nor needing more incumbrances alone
free from thy church's fetters and thy own
they say that thou wert lovely on thy bier
more lovely than in life that when the thrall
of earth was loosed it seemed as though a pall
of years were lifted and thou didst appear
such as of old amidst thy home's calm sphere
thou sat'st a kindly presence felt by all
in joy or grief from morn to evening fall
the peaceful genius of that mansion dear
was it the craft of all persuading love
that wrought this marvel or is death indeed
a mighty master gifted from above
with alchemy benign to wounded hearts
minist'ring thus by quaint and subtle arts
strange comfort whereon after thought may feed
a tremor shook the inmost heart of night
and starting up one cried the day has come
but others cursed him bidding him be dumb
the sun is dead there will be no more light
again the darkness trembled and again
and now there crept into the eastern sky
a hesitant greyness and a voiceless sigh
passed wakefully across the sleeping plain
then slowly very slowly one by one
leaves stirred and branches quivered till at last
expectant while the pulse of dawn beat fast
all nature waited breathless for the sun
the sun god drew his bow ray after ray
his arrows swept the heavens and lo 'twas day
peace rest content ah god to tired hearts
to feet that falter at the long road's end
to weary players that have played their parts
in the great drama these in fulness send
but unto us whose veins are quick with fire
whose wants are wide as earth and high as heaven
who spend our souls in some supreme desire
be no content but large impatience given
oh while the arm has strength to weight a blow
let there be fighting lord and deeds to dare
such deeds as ask the bravest and the best
mass thick the foes against us make us know
the sting of pain the threatening of despair
and so compell us to our loftiest
let those sore wounded with the spears of life
crave for oblivion those who gasp for breath
in the hot whirl of this perplexing strife
pray god to cease from striving after death
to each his heaven but what have we to do
with rest from labour we whose dearest thought
is still to match our model with the true
whose joy in life is in achievement wrought
god if thy pity lean towards man's hope
and thou wouldst see thy creatures each content
give us no resting but a larger scope
to strive and battle with impediment
give strength to fill our loftiest desire
that we may triumph where we now aspire
thou child of faith  whose little store of days
was beautiful with prayer whom reverence
made humble and white handed innocence
led purely thro' the dust of earthly ways
god spared thy soul the terror and amaze
of that fierce wrestling with omnipotence
which jacob knew at peniel the suspense
of aching doubt and error's long delays
thy spirit questioned not but saw fulfilled
the uttermost of love when calvary
beheld the consummation of all years
ah childlike trust so fair to us who build
the altar of our faith by dark degree
and join the stones together with our tears
o choir of tempe mute these many years
o fountain lutes of lyric hippocrene
on whose polluted brink no muse is seen
no more between the gleaming vales one hears
apollo's footfall or the sobbing tears
of daphne budding finger tips of green
no nymphs are bathing with their huntress queen
in the warm shallows of the mountain meres
great pan is dead he perished long ago
his reedy pipes these uplands never heard
what trembling sounds from yonder coppice come
some ravished queen who tells the dale her woe
nay since the maids pierian here are dumb
the nightingale is nothing but a bird
i heard a saint cry to the sun  be dim
why shouldst thou rule on high with boastful ray
till fools adore thee as the god of day
robbing thy master's honour due to him
but the sun spirit thro' each radiant limb
translucent as a living ember coal
glowed at the anger of the seraph soul
his golden orb trembled from boss to rim
then made he answer as a dove that sings
god's glory is my glory and my praise
only his praising they who kneel to me
see thro' the waving of my orient wings
a choir of stars with voices like the sea
singing hosanna in the heavenly ways
in ruling well what guerdon life runs low
as yonder lamp upon the hour glass lies
waning and wasted we are great and wise
but love is gone and silence seems to grow
along the misty road where we must go
from summits near the morning star's uprise
death comes a shadow from the northern skies
as when all leaves are down there comes the snow
brother and king we hold our last carouse
one loving cup we drain and then farewell
the night is spent the crystal morning ray
calls us as soldiers laurell'd on our brows
to march undaunted while the clarions swell
heroic hearts upon our lonely way
morning has come upon us  from the day
has rolled each darkling cloud the orient view
unveils with gorgeous sun and deep clear blue
but ocean riots still  in ponderous play
thousands of heavy surges plunge away
dazzling with snow white foam or swiftly woos
iris to paint all brightly tinted hues
strangely fair magic 'mid their shivered spray
around us many a little whale bird skims
dipping its tiny bosom in the deep
then instantly uprises blithe and high
even as the heart unthralled by earthly things
will walk this troubled earth yet ever keep
its dearest home up in the azure sky
under this shade of crimson wings abhorred
that never wholly leaves the sky serene
while vengeance sleeps a sleep so light between
dominions that acclaim thee overlord
sadly the blast of thy tremendous word
whate'er its mystic purport may have been
echoes across the ages nazarene
not to bring peace mine errand but a sword
for lo thy world uprises and lies down
in armor and its peace is war in all
save the great death that weaves war's dreadful crown
war unennobled by heroic pain
war without triumph without glorious fall
war that sits smiling with the eyes of cain
when london's plague that day by day enrolled
his thousands dead nor deigned his rage to abate
till grass was green in silent bishopsgate
had come and passed like thunder  still 'tis told
the monster driven to earth in hovels old
and haunts obscure though dormant lingered late
till the dread fire one roaring wave of fate
rose and swept clean his last retreat and hold
in europe live the dregs of plague today
dregs of full many an ancient plague and dire
old wrongs old lies of ages blind and cruel
what if alone the world war's world wide fire
can purge the ambushed pestilence away
yet woe to him that idly lights the fuel
a moment's fantasy the vision came
of europe dipped in fiery death and so
mounting re born with vestal limbs aglow
splendid and fragrant from her bath of flame
it fleeted and a phantom without name
sightless dismembered terrible said lo
i am that ravished europe men shall know
after the morn of blood and night of shame
the specter passed and i beheld alone
the europe of the present as she stands
powerless from terror of her own vast power
'neath novel stars beside a brink unknown
and round her the sad kings with sleepless hands
piling the fagots hour by doomful hour
my little chirping fire companion gay
whose merry gambols make me less alone
a blessing on thy glee be ever known
at evening hour when just the dying day
hath made light sad  thou hast a pleasant way
of muttering low in many a little tone
quaint syllables  that scarcely from his own
the cricket knows as pausing mid his play
sweet is thy precept in that listening hour
thou seemst to tell me with thy quiet mirth
how good is hope  regret how little worth
and perfect is thy love  if fate but lour
when sharpest frost impends dost merriest burn
the cold world leaves us  thou with kindlier burn
first thoughts are good and second thoughts are good
those most enrich us these do best advise
first thoughts are like first love and us surprise
with sudden bliss  till second thoughts intrude
fraught with wise doubts of much to be eschewed
not fit  where yet the greater danger lies
lest while we doubt the vision from our eyes
offended pass  thereafter vainly wooed
first thoughts are mistresses with heat pursued
and mad devotion  second thoughts are wives
oft wed in over prudence and a mood
most passionless  he wiseliest contrives
who adds the judgement while the love survives
for so shall second thoughts first thoughts include
young laughters and my music aye till now
the voice can reach no blending minors near
'tis the bird's trill because the spring is here
and spring means trilling on a blossomy bough
'tis the spring joy that has no why or how
but sees the sun and hopes not nor can fear
spring is so sweet and spring seems all the year
dear voice the first come birds but trill as thou
oh music of my heart be thus for long
too soon the spring bird learns the later song
too soon a sadder sweetness slays content
too soon there comes new light on onward day
there comes new perfume o'er a rosier way
comes not again the young spring joy that went
'tis men who say that through all hurt and pain
the woman's love wife's mother's still will hold
and breathes the sweeter and will more unfold
for winds that tear it and the sorrowful rain
so in a thousand voices has the strain
of this dear patient madness been retold
that men call woman's love ah they are bold
naming for love that grief which does remain
love faints that looks on baseness face to face
love pardons all but by the pardonings dies
with a fresh wound of each pierced through the breast
and there stand pityingly in love's void place
kindness of household wont familiar wise
and faith to love  faith to our dead at rest
she has made me wayside posies here they stand
bringing fresh memories of where they grew
as new come travellers from a world we knew
wake every while some image of their land
so these whose buds our woodland breezes fanned
bring to my room the meadow where they blew
the brook side cliff the elms where wood doves coo
and every flower is dearer for her hand
oh blossoms of the paths she loves to tread
some grace of her is in all thoughts you bear
for in my memories of your homes that were
the old sweet loneliness they kept is fled
and would i think it back i find instead
a presence of my darling mingling there
'tis hard that the full summer of our round
is but the turn where winter's sign post's writ
that to have reached the best is leaving it
that final loss bears date from having found
so some proud vessel in a narrow sound
sails at high water with the fair wind fit
and lo the ebb along the sandy spit
lower and lower till she jars aground
'tis hard we are young still but more content
'tis our ripe flush the heyday of our prime
we learn full breath how rich of the air we are
but suddenly we note a touch of time
a little fleck that scarcely seems to mar
and we know then that some time since youth went
the brook leaps riotous with its life just found
that freshets from the mountain rains have fed
beats at the boulders in its hindered bed
and fills the valley with its triumphing sound
the strong unthirsty tarn sunk in deep ground
has never a sigh wherewith its wealth is said
has no more ripples than the may flies tread
silence of waters is where they abound
and love whatever love sure makes small boast
'tis the new lovers tell in wonder yet
oh happy need enriched stream's jubilant gush
but who being spouses well have learned love's most
being child and mother learned not nor forget
these in their joyfulness feel the tarn's strong hush
birds sing i love you love the whole day through
and not another song can they sing right
but singing done with loving's done with quite
the autumn sunders every twittering two
and i'd not have love make too much ado
with sweet parades of fondness and delight
lest iterant wont should make caresses trite
love names mere cuckoo ousters of the true
oh heart can hear heart's sense in senseless nought
and heart that's sure of heart has little speech
what shall it tell the other knows its thought
what shall one doubt or question or beseech
who is assured and knows and unbesought
possesses the dear trust that each gives each
he sits amid the ceaseless ebb and flow
of human life in multitudes alone
and listens to their ceaseless monotone
his sightless eyes see never to and fro
the hurrying waves in divers eddies go
see not the shadows on that ocean thrown
by cliff like mocking walls of voiceless stone
which shore the restless tides that sweep below
among them yet not one of them sits he
and sends his clear toned music over all
charming the waves to music as they roll
even thus great thoughts sweep over life's vast sea
along the shores of time and the waves fall
and rise in rhythm under their control
pale roamer of the midnight hour when blow
the cutting winds and beat the pouring rain
then i bethink on thee and all the pain
you oft endure it is seldom thine to know
the look benignant and but few bestow
the gentle smile which timely might restrain
thy course licentious  thus from care and woe
with insults vile proceeds thy hard earned gain
pale roamer when i view thy haggard look
thy blue and quivering lip and sunken eye
hear thee accost each stranger passing by
in accents mild  to whom who thus forsook
thee in thy hour of need my heart has turned
and with a curse his unknown form i've spurned
what not a word for thee o little tome
brown jerkined friendly faced  of all my books
the one that wears the quaintest kindliest looks
seems most completely cosily at home
amongst its fellows  ah if thou couldst tell
thy story  how in sixteen fifty three
good master marriot standing at his door
saw anglers hurrying  fifty  nay threescore
to buy thee ere noon pealed from dunstan's bell
and how he stared and   shook his sides with glee
one story this which fact or fiction weaves
meanwhile adorn my shelf beloved of all
old book with lavender between thy leaves
and twenty ballads round thee on the wall
now that the earth has hid her lovely brood
of green things in her breast safe out of sight
and all the trees have stripped them for the fight
the winter comes with wild winds singing rude
hoarse battle songs  so furious in feud
that nothing lives that has not felt their bite
they sound a trumpet in the dead of night
that makes more solitary solitude
against the forest doors how fierce they beat
against the porch against the school bound boy
with crimson cheek bent to his shaggy coat
the earth is pale but steadfast hearing sweet
but far  how far away  the stream of joy
outpouring from a bluebird's tender throat
o master builder blustering as you go
about your giant work transforming all
the empty woods into a glittering hall
and making lilac lanes and footpaths grow
as hard as iron under stubborn snow
though every fence stand forth a marble wall
and windy hollows drift to arches tall
there comes a might that shall your might o'erthrow
build high your white and dazzling palaces
strengthen your bridges fortify your towers
storm with a loud and a portentious lip
and april with a fragmentary breeze
and half a score of gentle golden hours
shall leave no trace of your stern workmanship
the great soft downy snow storm like a cloak
descends to wrap the lean world head to feet
it gives the dead another winding sheet
it buries all the roofs until the smoke
seems like a soul that from its clay has broke
it broods moon like upon the autumn wheat
and visits all the trees in their retreat
to hood and mantle that poor shiv'ring folk
with wintry bloom it fills the harshest grooves
in jagged pine stump fences every sound
it hushes to the footstep of a nun
sweet charity that brightens where it moves
inducing darkest bits of churlish ground
to give a radiant answer to the sun
here in the crowded city's busy street
swayed by the eager jostling hasting throng
where traffic's voice grows harsher and more strong
i see within the stream of hurrying feet
a company of trees in their retreat
dew bathed dream wrapped and with a thrush's song
emparadizing all the place along
whose paths i hear the pulse of beauty beat
'twas yesterday i walked beneath the trees
to day i tread the city's stony ways
and still the spell that o'er my spirit came
turns harshest sounds to shy bird ecstasies
pours scent of pine through murky chimney haze
and gives each careworn face a woodland frame
dear grey winged angel with the mouth set stern
and time devouring eyes the sweetest sweet
of kisses when two severed lovers meet
is thine the cruellest ache in hearts that yearn
the fears that freeze the hopes that leap and burn
thine  thine and thine the drum and trumpet beat
of hearts that wait for unreturning feet
when comes at last the hour of their return
of love's fair ministers thou art the chief
to jaded souls asleep beside their vows
thou givest hopes keen joys and vague alarms
beneath thy touch the brown and yellow leaf
turns to pink blossom and the spring bright boughs
frame lovers running to each other's arms
gently most gently on thy victim's head
consumption lay thine hand let me decay
like the expiring lamp unseen away
and softly go to slumber with the dead
and if it is true what holy men have said
that strains angelic oft foretell the day
of death to those good men who fall thy prey
o let the aeumlrial music round my bed
dissolving slow in dying symphony
whisper the solemn warnings to my ear
that i may bid my weeping friends good bye
ere i depart upon my journey drear
and smiling faintly on the painful past
compose my decent head and breathe my last
yes it will be over soon  this sickly dream
of life will vanish from my feverish brain
and death my wearied spirit will redeem
from this wild region of unvaried pain
yon brook will glide as softly as before
yon landscape smile  yon golden harvest grow
yon sprightly lark on mounting wing will soar
when henry's name is heard no more below
i sigh when all my youthful friends caress
they laugh in health and future evils brave
them shall a wife and smiling children bless
while i am mouldering in my silent grave
god of the just thou gavest the bitter cup
i bow to thy behest and drink it up
as thus oppressed with many a heavy care
though young yet sorrowful i turn my feet
to the dark woodland longing much to greet
the form of peace if chance she sojourn there
deep thought and dismal verging to despair
fills my sad breast and tired with this vain coil
i shrink dismayed before life's upland toil
and as amid the leaves the evening air
whispers still melody
i think ere long
when i no more can hear these woods will speak
and then a sad smile plays upon my cheek
and mournful fantasies upon me throng
and i do ponder with most strange delight
on the calm slumbers of the dead man's night
misfortune i am young my chin is bare
and i have wondered much when men have told
how youth was free from sorrow and from care
that thou shouldst dwell with me and leave the old
sure dost not like me  shrivelled hag of hate
my phiz  and thanks to thee  is sadly long
i am not either beldame over strong
nor do i wish at all to be thy mate
for thou sweet fury art my utter hate
nay shake not thus thy miserable pate
i am yet young and do not like thy face
and lest thou shouldst resume the wild goose chase
i'll tell thee something all thy heat to assuage
thou wilt not hit my fancy in my age
let the sublimer muse who wrapt in night
rides on the raven pennons of the storm
or o'er the field with purple havock warm
lashes her steeds and sings along the fight
let her whom more ferocious strains delight
disdain the plaintive sonnet's little form
and scorn to its mild cadence to conform
the impetuous tenor of her hardy flight
but me far lowliest of the sylvan train
who wake the wood nymphs from the forest shade
with wildest song  me much behooves the aid
of mingled melody to grace my strain
and give it power to please as soft it flows
through the smooth murmurs of thy frequent close
soft music in those hazel eyes i see
and tho' as yet she keeps a silent shrine
and pours not forth her retinue divine
enthroneacuted there sits sovereign poesy
there slowly slowly kindle fancies free
while sweetest thoughts in that sweet face combine
to aid the goddess in her dear design
and wake at length in brightest symphony
if aught of art prophetic i possess
no lowly sphere for thee the fates ordain
but from those vermeil lips a loveliness
as yet unheard shall rise in raptured strain
till all the countless race of men confess
the god apollo sings on earth again
mysterious night when our first parent knew
thee from report divine and heard thy name
did he not tremble for this lovely frame
this glorious canopy of light and blue
yet 'neath a curtain of translucent dew
bathed in the rays of the great setting flame
hesperus with the host of heaven came
and lo creation widened in man's view
who could have thought such darkness lay concealed
within thy beams o sun or who could find
whilst fly and leaf and insect stood revealed
that to such countless orbs thou mad'st us blind
why do we then shun death with anxious strife
if light can thus deceive wherefore not life
my heart was heavy for its trust had been
abused its kindness answered with foul wrong
so turning gloomily from my fellow men
one summer sabbath day i strolled among
the green mounds of the village burial place
where pondering how all human love and hate
find one sad level and how soon or late
wronged and wrongdoer each with meekened face
and cold hands folded over a still heart
pass the green threshold of our common grave
whither all footsteps tend whence none depart
awed for myself and pitying my race
our common sorrow like a mighty wave
swept all my pride away and trembling i forgave
outbound your bark awaits you were i one
whose prayer availeth much my wish should be
your favoring trad wind and consenting sea
by sail or steed was never love outrun
and here or there love follows her in whom
all graces and sweet charities unite
the old greek beauty set in holier light
and her for whom new england's byways bloom
who walks among us welcome as the spring
calling up blossoms where her light feet stray
god keep you both make beautiful your way
comfort console and bless and safely bring
ere yet i make upon a vaster sea
the unreturning voyage my friends to me
o 'twas a ruthless deed enough to pale
freedom's bright fires that doom'd to shameful death
those that maintained their faith with latest breath
and scorn'd beneath the despot's frown to quail
yet 'twas a glorious hour when from the gaol
of papal tyranny the mind of man
dared to break loose and triumph in the ban
of thunders warring in the distant gale
yes old memorial of the mitred monk
thou livest to flourish in a brighter day
with seeming joy that pure and patriot vows
are breath'd where superstition reign'd thy trunk
its glad green garlands wears though in decay
and pious red breasts warble from thy boughs
to drift with every passion till my soul
is a stringed lute on which all winds can play
is it for this that i have given away
mine ancient wisdom and austere control
methinks my life is a twice written scroll
scrawled over on some boyish holiday
with idle songs for pipe and virelay
which do but mar the secret of the whole
surely there was a time i might have trod
the sunlit heights and from life's dissonance
struck one clear chord to reach the ears of god
is that time dead  lo with a little rod
i did but touch the honey of romance
and must i lose a soul's inheritance
come down o christ and help me reach thy hand
for i am drowning in a stormier sea
than simon on thy lake of galilee
the wine of life is spilt upon the sand
my heart is as some famine murdered land
whence all good things have perished utterly
and well i know my soul in hell must lie
if i this night before god's throne should stand
he sleeps perchance or rideth to the chase
like baal when his prophets howled that name
from morn to noon on carmel's smitten height
nay peace i shall behold before the night
the feet of brass the robe more white than flame
the wounded hands the weary human face
rid of the world's injustice and his pain
he rests at last beneath god's veil of blue
taken from life when life and love were new
the youngest of the martyrs here is lain
fair as sebastian and as early slain
no cypress shades his grave no funeral yew
but gentle violets weeping with the dew
weave on his bones an ever blossoming chain
o proudest heart that broke for misery
o sweetest lips since those of mitylene
o poet painter of our english land
thy name was writ in water  it shall stand
and tears like mine will keep thy memory green
as isabella did her basil tree
wing'd mimic of the woods thou motley fool
who shall thy gay buffoonery describe
thine ever ready notes of ridicule
pursue thy fellows still with jest and gibe
wit sophist songster yorick of thy tribe
thou sportive satirist of nature's school
to thee the palm of scoffing we ascribe
arch mocker and mad abbot of misrule
for such thou art by day  but all night long
thou pour'st a soft sweet pensive solemn strain
as if thou didst in this thy moonlight song
like to the melancholy jacques complain
musing on falsehood folly vice and wrong
and sighing for thy motley coat again
dear nan at thy command i string a sonnet
and must in rhyme surpass the italian skill
full fourteen lines with flimsy jingle fill
what fools we lovers are  i've thus begun it
the task is hard but yet i dare not shun it
i'll persevere and bid the muse distil
strength in my thought from her inspiring rill
till to the length required i've neatly spun it
but when at length thy fettered bard has done it
poor is the thought  the sentiment how chill
see where he stands knight of the dashing quill
bewigged a critic and he'll poop upon it
but let the witless growler have his will
i bargained for thy kiss and have now fairly won it
while soon the garden's flaunting flowers decay
and scattered on the earth neglected lie
the mountain daisy cherished by the ray
a poet drew from heaven shall never die
ah like that lonely flower the poet
mid penury's bare soil and bitter gale
he felt each storm that on the mountain blows
nor ever knew the shelter of the vale
by genius in her native vigour nursed
on nature with impassioned look he gazed
then through the cloud of adverse fortune burst
indignant and in light unborrowed blazed
scotia from rude affliction shield thy bard
his heaven taught numbers fame herself will guard
young rose that budded by eurotas's stream
i've thumbed through rand mcnally and    i know
all ages headline your shy april dream
and whisper helen    paris    yes it's so
homer retailed the rhythm of the oars
that scarred the sea of time in that wild ride
poets have peered and peeped of those old shores
where you    and war    splashed in scamander tide
your posthumous publicity fills reams
and reams of incandescent lyrics whirled
wherever man desires or woman dreams
of love with cheeks on fire and lids half furled
how far that little scandal sheds its beams
so shines a naughty deed in a good world
the measured lines their imageries reveal
and seek with purer thoughts the mind to fill
subdue the passions and enthrone the will
and in the heart some worthier impulse seal
to bless the world its needless cares disperse
the poet strives for highest realms of thought
his mind aflame with deep compassion fraught
will write his heart's convictions in his verse
his verse oft stirs emotion's deepest springs
from anguished souls the crushing pain decoys
in cheerless lives hope's sweetest anthem sings
and seals in hearts this life's sublimest joys
the bard unfolds in song thought's living power
like opening bud reveals the fragrant flower
the great titanic's hosts have gone to greet
the dead uncoffined in broad ocean's deep
around their hallowed tombs no mourners weep
nor sorrow's requiem o'er their graves repeat
the powers of fate man's feeble plans defeat
and rolling billows o'er the helpless sweep
and on their dark expanse their harvest reap
the rich and poor their like destructions meet
time soothes the sorrow and the wound will heal
the waves will sing to them their rhythmic song
may god's own hands their bodies guard and keep
and o'er those hallowed waters place his seal
to friends their memories only now belong
in ocean depths they rest and sweetly sleep
the sleepless night in awful anguish spent
great crimson drops the holy features steep
those left to watch in peaceful quiet sleep
the howling mob by treacherous priesthood sent
with swords and staves by faithless judas led
with vain salute hail master and that sign
a traitor's kiss  the frightened followers fled
and murderous demons seize their lord divine
the priestly court  false witnesses are sought
the roman court  not guilty  yet condemned
the cruel cross  a world's redemption bought
the quaking earth with awful darkness hemmed
the roman guard  the grave securely sealed
the opened tomb  the risen lord revealed
beneath the spreading limbs of forest bowers
like hermit sage he seeks sequestered nook
a thoughtful youth there hidden with his book
will gather knowledge through the silent hours
these garnered stores his hungry mind devours
as famished herds drink from the cooling brook
or bees which naught could tempt to overlook
the nectared sweetness of the fragrant flowers
the sturdy miner delves the earth for gold
for wealth the seaman sails to distant shore
the farmer toils by ripened grain fields toled
and slaving hosts bow at wealth's golden throne
the student gleans from fields by others sown
and reaps from books their more enduring store
the drear and lonesome season now has gone
and winter's sadness will be turned to mirth
the opening buds and smiling flowers each dawn
will greet with joy this gladder season's birth
the earth awakened from the winter's dearth
the robin chirps with glee o'er grassy lawn
and wilder spots have felt the sunbeam's worth
which charm to gayer pranks the sportive fawn
all nature smiles in springtime fashion dressed
the fertile fields resound with plowman's song
the noisy sparrow builds 'neath eaves her nest
the woodland trembles with the warbling throng
new life is born new hope inspires the breast
for spring has come and all the world is blest
the french creator rules the realm of style
with consummate skill lures aping crowds along
with gaudy frills their pliant minds beguile
and binds in fashion's chains the hapless throng
with bated breath they wait the stern command
of fashion's priest whose great creative mind
must mold the fashions of this glorious land
the vulgar frenchman clothes the world's refined
the rich and poor the humble and the great
must wear the garb these foreign lords devise
they dare not scorn the frenchman's fashion plate
but wear the garment though the style despise
the world still yields to style's deforming sway
and nature's sweetest charms they fling away
the gilded signs whose silent voices speak
reveal those hands which genius has endowed
to check the footsteps of the hurrying crowd
and guide unerring to the marts they seek
dark devious paths oft mark the crowded way
and dangerous pitfalls there the steps betide
the sign writer's work becomes a trusted guide
where by baths branch to lead the feet astray
sublime the work through power of genius born
though menial sphere may mark its lowly place
its beauty will earth's highest realms adorn
and lowest depths its guiding gleams embrace
the genius writes the sign to charm the eyes
still that he works for gain no one denies
the star that marked the birthplace of our king
shone bright above that bethlehem manger bed
and by its gleams wise shepherds' feet were led
to pay him homage and their treasures bring
now to this star the world's great nations cling
revere the power that raised him from the dead
with wreathes of love still crown that sacred head
and waft to heaven the song which angels sing
this song of peace on earth good will t'ward men
has charmed the vistas of earth's noblest thought
still guides the hand that wields immortal pen
and crowns him king who man's redemption bought
whose tireless feet o'er hill and valley's glen
from heaven to earth a priceless message brought
those cruel hordes with boastful pomp and pride
to please a tyrant's greed and lust for power
would drench in blood a land that will not cower
and bathe fair belgium in war's crimson tide
the rights of peaceful powers have been denied
nor woman's prayers nor childhood's tears this hour
could stay the hand that would their homes devour
and o'er their bleeding forms in triumph ride
faith's prayers ascend hope's voice to god appeals
that love might win against a tyrant's might
and heal the wounds this dreadful strife reveals
and honor belgium's stand for peace and right
time will record in blood an empire's shame
while belgium's triumph is an honored name
judge not a man by his smooth shining pate
when from his dome time has the covering shorn
and left that space like desert plains forlorn
while oft beneath are brains which compensate
think not that hair great sense must indicate
that sheltering locks do all wise heads adorn
for in his skull man's power to think was born
and wisdom's charms oft hairless crowns ornate
skulls void of hair without and lacking brains
when sportive nature works some foolish prank
for which misfortune naught could recompense
still without hair or with this truth remains
that human heads that reach life's highest rank
are those adorned with brains and common sense
creeds melted in the fires of modern thought
which truth has kindled into quenchless flame
has in its light revealed the crime and shame
of doctrines superstition's votaries taught
untold the anguish wicked creeds have brought
to those who dared a different faith proclaim
where at the stake they earned a martyr's name
and crowned a faith with honors dearly bought
time scarce can heal the wounds of cruel creeds
their crimson stains outlive the flight of years
though martyred saints shall reap immortal meads
and christian truth and love dispel earth's fears
no power of man can hide those barbarous deeds
nor wipe from history's page the martyr's tears
the world is too much with us late and soon
getting and spending  we lay waste our powers
little we see in nature that is ours
we have given our hearts away a sordid boon
the sea that bares her bosom to the moon
the winds that will be howling at all hours
and are up gathered now like sleeping flowers
for this for everything we are out of tune
it moves us not  great god i'd rather be
a pagan suckled in a creed outworn
so might i standing on this pleasant lea
have glimpses that would make me less forlorn
have sight of proteus rising from the sea
or hear old triton blow his wreathegraved horn
nuns fret not at their convent's narrow room
and hermits are contented with their cells
and students with their pensive citadels
maids at the wheel the weaver at his loom
sit blithe and happy bees that soar for bloom
high as the highest peak of furness fells
will murmur by the hour in foxglove bells
in truth the prison into which we doom
ourselves no prison is and hence for me
in sundry moods 'twas pastime to be bound
within the sonnet's scanty plot of ground
pleased if some souls for such there needs must be
who have felt the weight of too much liberty
should find brief solace there as i have found
great men have been among us hands that penned
and tongues that uttered wisdom  better none
the later sidney marvel harrington
young vane and others who called milton friend
these moralists could act and comprehend
they knew how genuine glory was put on
taught us how rightfully nation shone
in splendour what strength was that would not bend
but in magnanimous meekness france 'tis strange
hath brought forth no such souls as we had then
perpetual emptiness unceasing change
no single volume paramount no code
no master spirit no determined road
but equally a want of books and men
i love you for the grief that lurks within
your languid spirit and because you wear
corruption with a vague and childish air
and with your beauty know the depths of sin
because shame cuts and holds you like a gin
and virtue dies in you slain by despair
since evil has you tangled in its snare
and triumphs on the soul good cannot win
i love you since you know remorse and tears
and in your troubled loveliness appears
the spot of ancient crimes that writhe and hiss
i love you for your hands that calm and bless
the perfume of your sad and slow caress
the avid poison of your subtle kiss
flowers rare and sweet i sent whose delicate white
should grouping at her corsage interlace
their purity with her corrupted grace
with the full throat and mouth of my delight
evil design to see the pale flowers slight
the beauty of the worn and powdered face
mingling their costly virtue with the trace
of ancient loves that live in time's despite
how soon they died poor blossoms at her throat
ere of the last valse died the last sad note
no more than love of her meant to endure
for all the savour of her lips the spice
of her frail spirit steeped in cultured vice
gracefully bad and delicately impure
i hate the flower of wood or common field
i cannot love the primrose nor regret
the death of any shrinking violet
nor even the cultured garden's banal yield
the silver lips of lilies virginal
the full deep bosom of the enchanted rose
please less than flowers glass hid from frost and snows
for whom an alien heat makes festival
i love those flowers reared by man's careful art
of heady scents and colors strong of heart
or weak that die beneath the touch of knife
some rich as sin and some as virtue pale
and some as subtly infamous and frail
as she whose love still eats my soul and life
when night's black mantle could most darkness prove
and sleep death's image did my senses hire
from knowledge of myself then thoughts did move
swifter than those most switness need require
in sleep a chariot drawn by wing'd desire
i saw where sate bright venus queen of love
and at her feet her son still adding fire
to burning hearts which she did hold above
but one heart flaming more than all the rest
the goddess held and put it to my breast
dear son now shoot she said this must we win
he her obeyed and martyr'd my poor heart
i waking hop'd as dreams it would depart
yet since o me a lover have i been
dear eyes how well indeed you do adorn
that blessed sphere which gazing souls hold dear
the loved place of sought for triumphs near
the court of glory where love's force was born
how may they term you april's sweetest morn
when pleasing looks from those bright lights appear
a sun shine day from clouds and mists still clear
kind nursing fires for wishes yet unborn
two stars of heaven sent down to grace the earth
plac'd in that throne which gives all joys their birth
shining and burning pleasing yet their charms
which wounding even in hurts are deem'd delights
so pleasant is their force  so great their mights
as happy they can triumph in their harms
yet is their hope  then love but play thy part
remember well thy self and think on me
shine in those eyes which conquer'd have my heart
and see if mine be slack to answer thee
lodge in that breast and pity moving see
for flames which in mine burn in truest smart
exiling thoughts that touch inconstancy
or those which waste not in the constant art
watch but my sleep if i take any rest
for thought of you my spiritt soe distressed
as pale and famish'd i for mercy cry
will you your servant leave  think but on this
who wears love's crown must not do so amiss
but seek their good who on thy force do lie
forbear dark night my joys now bud again
lately grown dead while cold aspects did chill
the root at heart and my chief hope quite kill
and thunders struck me in my pleasures' wane
then i alas with bitter sobs and pain
privately groan'd my fortunes present ill
all light of comfort dimm'd woes in prides fill
with strange increase of grief i griev'd in vain
and most when as a memory too good
molested me which still as witness stood
of those best days in former time i knew
late gone as wonders past like the great snow
melted and wasted with what change must know
now back the life comes where as once it grew
can pleasing sight misfortune ever bring
can firm desire a painful torment try
can winning eyes prove to the heart a sting
or can sweet lips in treason hidden lie
the sun most pleasing blinds the strongest eye
if too much look'd on breaking the sight's string
desires still crossed must unto mischief hye
and as despair a luckless chance may fling
eyes having won rejecting proves a sting
killing the bud before the tree doth spring
sweet lips not loving do as poison prove
desire sight eyes lips seek see prove and find
you love may win but curses if unkind
then show you harm's dislike and joy in love
now god be thanked who has watched us with his hour
and caught our youth and wakened us from sleeping
with hand made sure clear eye and sharpened power
to turn as swimmers into cleanness leaping
glad from a world grown old and cold and weary
leave the sick hearts that honour could not move
and half men and their dirty songs and dreary
and all the little emptiness of love
oh we who have known shame we have found release there
where there's no ill no grief but sleep has mending
naught broken save this body lost but breath
nothing to shake the laughing heart's long peace there
but only agony and that has ending
and the worst friend and enemy is but death
dear of all happy in the hour most blest
he who has found our hid security
assured in the dark tides of the world that rest
and heard our word 'who is so safe as we'
we have found safety with all things undying
the winds and morning tears of men and mirth
the deep night and birds singing and clouds flying
and sleep and freedom and the autumnal earth
we have built a house that is not for time's throwing
we have gained a peace unshaken by pain for ever
war knows no power safe shall be my going
secretly armed against all death's endeavour
safe though all safety's lost safe where men fall
and if these poor limbs die safest of all
blow out you bugles over the rich dead
there's none of these so lonely and poor of old
but dying has made us rarer gifts than gold
these laid the world away poured out the red
sweet wine of youth gave up the years to be
of work and joy and that unhoped serene
that men call age and those who would have been
their sons they gave their immortality
blow bugles blow they brought us for our dearth
holiness lacked so long and love and pain
honour has come back as a king to earth
and paid his subjects with a royal wage
and nobleness walks in our ways again
and we have come into our heritage
these hearts were woven of human joys and cares
washed marvellously with sorrow swift to mirth
the years had given them kindness dawn was theirs
and sunset and the colours of the earth
these had seen movements and heard music known
slumber and waking loved gone proudly friended
felt the quick stir of wonder sat alone
touched flowers and furs and cheeks all this is ended
there are waters blown by changing winds to laughter
and lit by the rich skies all day and after
frost with a gesture stays the waves that dance
and wandering loveliness he leaves a white
unbroken glory a gathered radiance
a width a shining peace under the night
if i should die think only this of me
that there's some corner of a foreign field
that is for ever england there shall be
in that rich earth a richer dust concealed
a dust whom england bore shaped made aware
gave once her flowers to love her ways to roam
a body of england's breathing english air
washed by the rivers blest by suns of home
and think this heart all evil shed away
a pulse in the eternal mind no less
gives somewhere back the thoughts by england given
her sights and sounds dreams happy as her day
and laughter learnt of friends and gentleness
in hearts at peace under an english heaven
what passing bells for these who die as cattle
only the monstrous anger of the guns
only the stuttering rifles' rapid rattle
can patter out their hasty orisons
no mockeries now for them no prayers nor bells
nor any voice of mourning save the choirs
the shrill demented choirs of wailing shells
and bugles calling for them from sad shires
what candles may be held to speed them all
not in the hands of boys but in their eyes
shall shine the holy glimmers of good byes
the pallor of girls' brows shall be their pall
their flowers the tenderness of patient minds
and each slow dusk a drawing down of blinds
be slowly lifted up thou long black arm
great gun towering towards heaven about to curse
sway steep against them and for years rehearse
huge imprecations like a blasting charm
reach at that arrogance which needs thy harm
and beat it down before its sins grow worse
spend our resentment cannon  yea disburse
our gold in shapes of flame our breaths in storm
yet for men's sakes whom thy vast malison
must wither innocent of enmity
be not withdrawn dark arm thy spoilure done
safe to the bosom of our prosperity
but when thy spell be cast complete and whole
may god curse thee and cut thee from our soul
after the blast of lightning from the east
the flourish of loud clouds the chariot throne
after the drums of time have rolled and ceased
and by the bronze west long retreat is blown
shall life renew these bodies of a truth
all death will he annul all tears assuage
or fill these void veins full again with youth
and wash with an immortal water age
when i do ask white age he saith not so
'my head hangs weighed with snow'
and when i hearken to the earth she saith
'my fiery heart shrinks aching it is death
mine ancient scars shall not be glorified
nor my titanic tears the seas be dried'
soldiers are citizens of death's gray land
drawing no dividend from time's tomorrows
in the great hour of destiny they stand
each with his feuds and jealousies and sorrows
soldiers are sworn to action they must win
some flaming fatal climax with their lives
soldiers are dreamers when the guns begin
they think of firelit homes clean beds and wives
i see them in foul dugouts gnawed by rats
and in the ruined trenches lashed with rain
dreaming of things they did with balls and bats
and mocked by hopeless longing to regain
bank holidays and picture shows and spats
and going to the office in the train
you love us when we're heroes home on leave
or wounded in a mentionable place
you worship decorations you believe
that chivalry redeems the war's disgrace
you make us shells you listen with delight
by tales of dirt and danger fondly thrilled
you crown our distant ardours while we fight
and mourn our laurelled memories when we're killed
you can't believe that british troops 'retire'
when hell's last horror breaks them and they run
trampling the terrible corpses  blind with blood
o german mother dreaming by the fire
while you are knitting socks to send your son
his face is trodden deeper in the mud
lost in the swamp and welter of the pit
he flounders off the duck boards only he knows
each flash and spouting crash  each instant lit
when gloom reveals the streaming rain he goes
heavily blindly on and while he blunders
could anything be worse than this  he wonders
remembering how he saw those germans run
screaming for mercy among the stumps of trees
green faced they dodged and darted there was one
livid with terror clutching at his knees
our chaps were sticking 'em like pigs    o hell
he thought  there's things in war one dare not tell
poor father sitting safe at home who reads
of dying heroes and their deathless deeds
you've heard me scornful harsh and discontented
of my old silly sweetness i've repented
you are aware that once i sought the grail
and it was told that through my infant wail
but now i've said good bye to galahad
for lust and senseless hatred make me glad
wound for red wound i burn to smite their wrongs
and there is absolution in my songs
when you see millions of the mouthless dead
across your dreams in pale battalions go
say not soft things as other men have said
that you'll remember for you need not so
give them not praise for deaf how should they know
it is not curses heaped on each gashed head
nor tears their blind eyes see not your tears flow
nor honour it is easy to be dead
say only this 'they are dead' then add thereto
'yet many a better one has died before'
then scanning all the o'ercrowded mass should you
perceive one face that you loved heretofore
it is a spook none wears the face you knew
great death has made all his for evermore
she was a city of patience of proud name
dimmed by neglecting time of beauty and loss
of acquiescence in the creeping moss
but on a sudden fierce destruction came
tigerishly pouncing thunderbolt and flame
showered on her streets to shatter them and toss
her ancient towers to ashes riven across
she rose dead into never dying fame
white against heavens of storm a ghost she is known
to the world's ends the myriads of the brave
sleep round her desolately glorified
she moon like draws her own far moving tide
of sorrow and memory toward her each alone
glide the dark dreams that seek an english grave
i walked in loamy wessex lanes afar
from rail track and from highway and i heard
in field and farmstead many an ancient word
of local lineage like thu bist er war
ich woll er sholl and by talk similar
nigh as they speak who in this month's moon gird
at england's very loins thereunto spurred
by gangs whose glory threats and slaughters are
then seemed a heart crying whosoever they be
at root and bottom of this who flung this flame
between folk kin tongued even as are we
sinister ugly lurid be their fame
may their familiars grow to shun their name
and their brood perish everlastingly
brothers in blood  they who this wrong began
to wreck our commonwealth will rue the day
when first they challenged freemen to the fray
and with the briton dared the american
now are we pledged to win the rights of man
labor and justice now shall have their way
and in a league of peace  god grant we may
transform the earth not patch up the old plan
sure is our hope since he who led your nation
spake for mankind and ye arose in awe
of that high call to work the world's salvation
clearing your minds of all estranging blindness
in the vision of beauty and the spirit's law
freedom and honor and sweet loving kindness
you whose forebodings have been all fulfilled
you who have heard the bell seen the boy stand
holding the flimsy message in his hand
while through your heart the fiery question thrilled
wounded or killed which which  and it was killed
and in a kind of trance have read it numb
but conscious that the dreaded hour was come
no dream this dream wherewith your blood was chilled
oh brothers in calamity unknown
companions in the order of black loss
lift up your hearts for your are not alone
and let our sombre hosts together bring
their sorrows to the shadow of the cross
and learn the fellowship of suffering
in sodden trenches i have heard men speak
though numb and wretched wise and witty things
and loved them for the stubbornness that clings
longest to laughter when death's pulleys creak
and seeing cool nurses move on tireless feet
to do abominable things with grace
deemed them sweet sisters in that haunted place
where with child's voices strong men howl or bleat
yet now those men lay stubborn courage by
riding dull eyed and silent in the train
to old men's stools or sell gay coloured socks
and listen fearfully for death so i
love the low laughing girls who now again
go daintily in thin and flowery frocks
if i should die think only this of me
that there's some corner of a foreign field
that is for ever england
if you should die think only this of me
in that still quietness where is space for thought
where parting loss and bloodshed shall not be
and men may rest themselves and dream of nought
that in some place a mystic mile away
one whom you loved has drained the bitter cup
till there is nought to drink has faced the day
once more and now has raised the standard up
and think my son with eyes grown clear and dry
she lives as though for ever in your sight
loving the things you loved with heart aglow
for country honour truth traditions high
proud that you paid their price and if some night
her heart should break  well lad you will not know
in the first watch no death but made us mourn
now tearless eyes run down the daily roll
whose names are written in the book of death
for sealed are now the springs of tears as when
the tropic sun makes dry the torrent's course
after the rains they are too many now
for mortal eyes to weep and none can see
but god alone the thing itself and live
we look to seaward and behold a cry
to skyward and they fall as stricken birds
on autumn fields and earth cries out its toll
from the great river to the world's end  toll
of dead and maimed and lost we dare not stay
tears are not endless and we have no more
indifferent flippant earnest but all bored
the doctors sit in the glare of electric light
watching the endless stream of naked white
bodies of men for whom their hasty award
means life or death maybe or the living death
of mangled limbs blind eyes or a darkened brain
and the chairman as his monocle falls again
pronounces each doom with easy indifferent breath
then suddenly i shudder as i see
a young man stand before them wearily
cadaverous as one already dead
but still they stare untroubled as he stands
with arms outstretched and drooping thorn crowned head
the nail marks glowing in his feet and hands
i dreamt last night christ came to earth again
to bless his own  my soul from place to place
on her dream quest sped seeking for his face
through temple and town and lovely land in vain
then came i to a place where death and pain
had made of god's sweet world a waste forlorn
with shattered trees and meadows gashed and torn
where the grim trenches scarred the shell sheared plain
and through that golgotha of blood and clay
where watchers cursed the sick dawn heavy eyed
there in my dream christ passed upon his way
where his cross marks their nameless graves who died
slain for the world's salvation where all day
for others' sake strong men are crucified
at least it wasn't your fault i hear them console
when they come back the few that will come back
i feel those handshakes now well on the whole
you didn't miss much  i wish i had your knack
of stopping out  you still can call your soul
your own at any rate  what a priceless slack
you've had old chap  it must have been top hole
how's poetry  i bet you've written a stack
what shall i say  that it's been damnable
that all the time my soul was never my own
that we've slaved hard at endless make believe
it isn't only actual war that's hell
i'll say  it's spending youth and hope alone
among pretences that have ceased to deceive
i watched the boys of england where they went
through mud and water to do appointed things
see one a stake and one wire netting brings
and one comes slowly under a burden bent
of ammunition  though the strength be spent
they carry on under the shadowing wings
of death the ever present  and hark one sings
although no joy from the grey skies be lent
are these the heroes  these have kept from you
the power of primal savagery so long
shall break the devil's legions  these they are
who do in silence what they might boast to do
in the height of battle tell the world in song
how they do hate and fear the face of war
caesar when that the traitor of egypt
with th'honorable head did him present
covering his gladness did represent
plaint with his tears outward as it is writ
and hanniball eke when fortune him shit
clean from his reign and from all his intent
laughed to his folk whom sorrow did torment
his cruel despite for to disgorge and quit
so chanceth it oft that every passion
the mind hideth by colour contrary
with feigned visage now sad now merry
whereby if i laughed any time or season
it is for because i have n'other way
to cloak my care but under sport and play
the long love that in my heart doth harbor
and in mine heart doth keep his residence
into my face presseth with bold pretense
and there campeth displaying his banner
she that me learneth to love and to suffer
and wills that my trust and lust's negligence
be reined by reason shame and reverence
with his hardiness taketh displeasure
wherewith love to the heart's forest he fleeth
leaving his enterprise with pain and cry
and there him hideth and not appeareth
what may i do when my master feareth
but in the field with him to live and die
for good is the life ending faithfully
whoso list to hunt i know where is an hind
but as for me alas i may no more
the vain travail hath wearied me so sore
i am of them that furthest come behind
yet may i by no means my wearied mind
draw from the deer but as she fleeth afore
fainting i follow i leave off therefore
since in a net i seek to hold the wind
who list her hunt i put him out of doubt
as well as i may spend his time in vain
and graven with diamonds in letters plain
there is written her fair neck round about
noli me tangere for caesar's i am
and wild for to hold though i seem tame
was i never yet of your love grieved
nor never shall while that my life doth last
but of hating myself that date is past
and tears continual sore have me wearied
i will not yet in my grave be buried
nor on my tomb yoiur name yfixed fast
as cruel cause that did the spirit soon haste
from th'unhappy bones by great sighs stirred
then if an heart of amorous faith and will
may content you without doing grief
please it you so to this to do relief
if otherwise ye seek for to fulfill
your disdain ye err and shall not as ye ween
and ye yourself the cause thereof hath been
if amorous faith in heart unfeigned
a sweet languor a great lovely desire
if honest will kindled in gentle fire
if long error in a blind maze chained
if in my visage each thought depainted
or else in my sparkling voice lower or higher
which now fear now shame woefully doth tire
if a pale colour which love hath stained
if to have another than myself more dear
if wailing or sighing continually
with sorrowful anger feeding busily
if burning afar off and freezing near
are cause that by love myself i destroy
yours is the fault and mine the great annoy
my heart i gave thee not to do it pain
but to preserve it was to thee taken
i served thee not to be forsaken
but that i should be rewarded again
i was content thy servant to remain
but not to be paid under this fashion
now since in thee is none other reason
displease thee not if that i do refrain
unsatiate of my woe and thy desire
assured by craft to excuse thy fault
but since it please thee to feign a default
farewell i say parting from the fire
for he that believeth bearing in hand
plougheth in water and soweth in the sand
some fowls there be that have so perfect sight
again the sun their eyes for to defend
and some because the light doth them offend
do never 'pear but in the dark or night
other rejoice that see the fire bright
and ween to play in it as they do pretend
and find the contrary of it that they intend
alas of that sort i may be by right
for to withstand her look i am not able
and yet can i not hide me in no dark place
remembrance so followeth me of that face
so that with teary eyen swollen and unstable
my destiny to behold her doth me lead
yet do i know i run into the gleed
because i have thee still kept from lies and blame
and to my power always have i thee honoured
unkind tongue right ill hast thou me rendered
for such desert to do me wreak and shame
in need of succour most when that i am
to ask reward then standest thou like one afeard
alway most cold and if thou speak toward
it is as in dream unperfect and lame
and ye salt tears again my will each night
that are with me when fain i would be alone
then are ye gone when i should make my moan
and you so ready sighs to make me shright
then are ye slack when that ye should outstart
and only my look declareth my heart
i find no peace and all my war is done
i fear and hope i burn and freeze like ice
i fly above the wind yet can i not arise
and nought i have and all the world i seize on
that locketh nor loseth holdeth me in prison
and holdeth me not yet can i 'scape nowise
nor letteth me live nor die at my devise
and yet of death it giveth me occasion
without eyen i see and without tongue i 'plain
i desire to perish and yet i ask health
i love another and thus i hate myself
i feed me in sorrow and laugh in all my pain
likewise displeaseth me both death and life
and my delight is causer of this strife
though i myself be bridled of my mind
returning me backward by force express
if thou seek honour to keep thy promise
who may thee hold my heart but thou thyself unbind
sigh then no more since no way man may find
thy virtue to let though that frowardness
of fortune me holdeth and yet as i may guess
though other be present thou art not all behind
suffice it then that thou be ready there
at all hours still under the defence
of time truth and love to save thee from offence
crying i burn in a lovely desire
with my dear master's that may not follow
whereby his absence turneth him to sorrow
my galley charged with forgetfulness
through sharp seas in winter nights doth pass
tween rock and rock and eke my foe alas
that is my lord steereth with cruelness
and every oar a thought in readiness
as though that death were light in such a case
an endless wind doth tear the sail apace
of forced sighs and trusty fearfulness
a rain of tears a cloud of dark distain
have done the wearied cords great hinderance
wreathed with error and eke with ignorance
the stars be hid that lead me to this pain
drowned is reason that should me consort
and i remain despairing of the port
avising the bright beams of these fair eyes
where he is that mine oft moisteth and washeth
the worried mind straight from the heart departeth
for to rest his worldly paradise
and find the sweet bitter under this guise
what webs he hath wrought well he perceiveth
whereby with himself on love he plaineth
that spurreth with fire and bridleth with ice
thus is it in such extremity brought
in frozen thought now and now it standeth in flame
'twixt misery and wealth 'twixt earnest and game
but few glad and many a diverse thought
with sore repentance of his hardiness
of such a root cometh fruit fruitless
ever mine hap is slack and slow in coming
desire increasing mine hope uncertain
that leave it or wait it doth me like pain
and tiger like swift it is in parting
alas the snow shall be black and scalding
the sea waterless fish in the mountain
the thames shall return back into his fountain
and where he rose the sun shall take lodging
ere that i in this find peace or quietness
in that love or my lady rightwisely
leave to conspire again me wrongfully
and if that i have after such bitterness
anything sweet my mouth is out of taste
that all my trust and travail is but waste
love and fortune and my mind rememb'rer
of that that is now with that that hath been
do torment me so that i very often
envy them beyond all measure
love slayeth mine heart  fortune is depriver
of all my comfort  the foolish mind then
burneth and plaineth as one that seldom
liveth in rest still in displeasure
my pleasant days they fleet away and pass
but daily yet the ill doth change into the worse
and more than the half is run of my course
alas not of steel but of brickle glass
i see that from mine hand falleth my trust
and all my thoughts are dashed into dust
how oft have i my dear and cruel foe
with those your eyes for to get peace and truce
proffered you mine heart  but you do not use
among so high things to cast your mind so low
if any other look for it as ye trow
their vain weak hope doth greatly them abuse
and thus i disdain that that ye refuse
it was once mine it can no more be so
if i then it chase nor it in you can find
in this exile no manner of comfort
nor live alone nor where he is called resort
he may wander from his natural kind
so shall it be great hurt unto us twain
and yours the loss and mine the deadly pain
like to these immeasurable mountains
is my painful life the burden of ire
for of great height be they and high is my desire
and i of tears and they be full of fountains
under craggy rocks they have full barren plains
hard thoughts in me my woeful mind doth tire
small fruit and many leaves their tops do attire
small effect with great trust in me remains
the boist'rous winds oft their high boughs do blast
hot sighs from me continually be shed
cattle in them and in me love is fed
immovable am i and they are full steadfast
of the restless birds they have the tune and note
and i always plaints that pass thorough my throat
farewell love and all thy laws forever
thy baited hooks shall tangle me no more
senec and plato call me from thy lore
to perfect wealth my wit for to endeavor
in blind error when i did persever
thy sharp repulse that pricketh aye so sore
taught me in trifles that i set no store
but scape forth since liberty is lever
therefore farewell go trouble younger hearts
and in me claim no more authority
with idle youth go use thy property
and thereon spend thy many brittle darts
for hitherto though i have lost my time
me list no longer rotten boughs to climb
unstable dream according to the place
be steadfast once or else at least be true
by tasted sweetness make me not to rue
the sudden loss of thy false feigned grace
by good respect in such a dangerous case
thou broughtest not her into this tossing mew
but madest my sprite live my care to renew
my body in tempest her succour to embrace
the body dead the sprite had his desire
painless was th' one th' other in delight
why then alas did it not keep it right
returning to leap into the fire
and where it was at wish it could not remain
such mocks of dreams they turn to deadly pain
divers doth use as i have heard and know
when that to change their ladies do begin
to mourn and wail and never for to lin
hoping thereby to pease their painful woe
and some there be that when it chanceth so
that women change and hate where love hath been
they call them false and think with words to win
the hearts of them which otherwhere doth grow
but as for me though that by chance indeed
change hath outworn the favor that i had
i will not wail lament nor yet be sad
nor call her false that falsely did me feed
but let it pass and think it is of kind
that often change doth please a woman's mind
poets make pets of pretty docile words i love smooth words like gold enameled fish which circle slowly with a silken swish and tender ones like downy feathered birds words shy and dappled deep eyed deer in herds come to my hand and playful if i wish or purring softly at a silver disk blue persian kittens fed on cream and curds i love bright words words up and singing early words that are luminous in the dark and sing warm lazy words white cattle under trees i love words opalescent cool and pearly like midsummer moths and honied words like bees gilded and sticky with a little sting
mounting his stairs of azure and of gold
the english lark sings in the august weather
for joy which knoweth neither tie nor tether
and is not troubled if the world grows old
while you who were as blithesome and as bold
and held your life lightly as any feather
sleep the high sleep that dead men sleep together
careless of what is done and what is told
i know that all england shone before you
when you went down it made a radiance
even of the front of death oh woman's son
you died for england   valiant as she that bore you
and sent you forth with a still countenance
and broke her heart for england and lives on
these are the fights of love and joy and men
with fate and death and the illicit beast
for guerdons of which glory is the least
and honour not the highest the old reign
of night shall topple the old wrongs be slain
fitting it is that you go to the feast
while ange suns kindle the young eyed east
and bring the breath of eden back again
oh soldiers' hour    for now the english rose
flames and is washed with the authentic dew
and through the mist her ancient crimson shows
i see your shadows on the waking lawn
like shadows of kings and all the souls of you
blazoned and bright and panoplied in the dawn
he goeth and he returns not he is dead
their house of joy no further brightness shows
their loveliness is come unto its close
their last touch given and their last kindness said
for him no more the vision of her bent head
for her no more the lily or the rose
nor any gladness in this place of woes
the book is shut the bitter lesson read
yet who shall beat them down though the abhorred
taketh the groom and to the bride hath sent
the dagger of anguish with the ice cold hilt
both of them triumph in a strange content
and out of souls like these will heavens be built
and holy cities peopled for the lord
along the english lanes a budding green
upon the english orchards pink and white
and over them the rapture and delight
of april sunshine fair and fresh and clean
washen as if in wells of hyaline
and very wondrous to the pilgrim sight
a glad new land of all things soft and bright
oh surely here an angel must have been
and left his blessing    dead young son of ours
who didst so proudly taste the loving cup
whose blood but now shone like a living rose
dropped by the lord upon the flanders snows
what country shall they give you to be yours
for this the england you have given up
he is gone hence weep no weak tears for him
you gave us freely what you valued most
it is not loss for gifts are never lost
unto the giver lo the star kept dim
limits where battle fades away and grim
death halts and hath no power  on that coast
his feet are set among the shining host
who range with cherubim and seraphim
a thousand suns are unregarded dust
a million dawns break and are counted not
and beauty riseth up and she departs
eternally  eternally forgot
but your fair stripling dead beside his trust
is safely folded in the heart of hearts
the enemy without  and he within
you meet him on the stairs of your high tower
all simpers at his nose he hath a flower
upon his tongue cheap honey and his chin
waggeth for ever if we lose or win
please don't talk war the witty luncheon hour
the joyous week end good souls who could sour
so blithe a spirit or prick so sleek a skin
cheerfullest wight it is his constant whim
to beam on fate all that he asks is love
a salad a glass of wine music that charms
a book a friend and the blue sky above
and underneath the everlasting arms
of them that toil and groan and bleed for him
i have a widow'd mother to whom i cleave
with a devouring passion my sole care
and joy she is what money i can spare
is hers  when she can get it if i leave
upon your urgent errand she will grieve
poor soul and find no comfort anywhere
beauty draws some men my a single hair
but me  i'm all for mother please believe
a boy's best friend's his mother without a doubt
and a most excellent mother have i got
'tis true the other day she said you go
i'll struggle through i murmured certainly not
sharp like and firm   dear heart she'll never know
how much i've loved her  since the war broke out
in me behold the trusty stay and prop
of mr cheesemonger he calls me sam
i mix his eggs and cut his splendid ham
and clean his windows and sweep up his shop
and drive his pony till it's fit to drop
and help his customers into the tram
i'm indispensable i am i am
and if i went the business would go flop
kind mr c remarks a pretty thing
to want my right hand man  and like their cheek
now who comes first your country and your king
or me of course i answered you do sir
he raised my screw to eighteen bob a week
and claims exempton for a manager
and i  ah mine's a bitter case indeed
you call me slacker coward what you will
i have a patent duty to fulfil
by my white soul whose promptings i must heed
it's not my fault if heroes choose to bleed
blood i abhor and no man's blood i'll spill
my conscience simply will not let me kill
the sixth commandment's plain for all to read
clearly who fights is either wicked or mad
and rage and malice are the spawn of hell
no quarrel have i with germans or with turks
i'm single  yes  profession  i used to sell
cats' meat before the war but times being bad
i've taken a job at a munition works
